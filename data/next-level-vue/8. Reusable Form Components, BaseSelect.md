# Reusable Form Components, BaseSelect

In the previous tutorial, we looked at how base form components can help our app‚Äôs forms be more modular, reusable and therefor cohesive. In this lesson, we‚Äôre going to continue breaking apart the form in our example app, this time looking at encapsulating our select code into its own **BaseSelect** component.


----------
## Creating BaseSelect

Taking another look at our **EventCreate** file, we have a couple places where we‚Äôre using a `select` input for our users to choose an `option` for the `event.category` and `event.time`.

üìÉ **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <label>Select a category</label>
    <select v-model="event.category">
      <option v-for="cat in categories" :key="cat">{{ cat }}</option>
    </select>
    ...
    <label>Select a time</label>
    <select v-model="event.time">
      <option v-for="time in times" :key="time">{{ time }}</option>
    </select>
```
Let‚Äôs now make a **BaseSelect** component to encapsulate this into something we can reuse throughout an app. Since this component will be very similar to our **BaseInput**, we‚Äôll just copy that code, paste it into a new **BaseSelect.vue** file, and tweak it.

üìÉ **src/components/BaseSelect.vue**
```javascript
    <template>
      <div>
        <label v-if="label">{{ label }}</label>
        <input
          :id="label"
          :value="value"
          v-bind="$attrs"
          @input="updateValue"
        />
      </div>
    </template>
    <script>
    export default {
      inheritAttrs: false,
      props: {
        value: [String, Number]
        label: String
      },
      methods: {
        updateValue(event) {
          this.$emit('input', event.target.value)
        }
      }
    }
    </script>
```
So what needs to change? We still need the `label`, so that‚Äôll stay the same. But instead of the `input` we need to swap that out for a `select` and `option` elements, like so:

üìÉ **src/components/BaseSelect.vue**
```html
    <select :value="value" 
            @change="updateValue" 
            v-bind="$attrs">
      <option v-for="option in options"
              :selected="option === value"
              :value="option" 
              :key="option">
              {{ option }}
      </option>
    </select>
```
Looking at the `select` element, we‚Äôre still binding to our `value` prop and our `$attrs`, but now we‚Äôre listening for an option to be selected with `@change`, which triggers our `updateValue` method, just like in our **BaseInput** component.

On the `option` element, we use `v-for` to create a new element for each `option` we have in our `options` prop. 

We‚Äôre also checking to see if the `option` matches our `value` prop. If it does, we‚Äôll add the `selected` attribute so that we can set the initial value of this `select` input.  

And use it to set the `value` and `key` of each option element.

However, our `options` data lives on the parent, so we need to give **BaseSelect** `options` as a prop.

üìÉ **src/components/BaseSelect.vue**
```javascript
      props: {
        options: { // <-- new prop
          type: Array,
          required: true
        },
        value: [String, Number]
        label: String
      },
```
We‚Äôd pass in the options in **EventCreate** like this:

üìÉ **src/components/BaseSelect.vue**
```html
    <BaseSelect
      v-model="event.category"
      label="Select a category"
      :options="categories" <!-- passing in our categories options -->
    />
```
When we check this out in the browser, we see the **BaseSelect** component is showing up, and it‚Äôs full of our `categories`. But when we select a category, and our `updateValue` method is run, we‚Äôre not receiving that `'input'` event and its payload in our parent scope.

So we need to add that in **EventCreate**.

üìÉ **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <BaseSelect label="Select a category" :options="categories" v-model="event.category"/>
```
As you can see, we added `v-model=``"event.category"`. As we learned in our [previous lesson](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/next-level-vue/reusable-form-components-baseinput), using `v-model` here allows us to listen for the `'input'` event that was sent up from **BaseSelect**‚Äôs `updateValue` method. And when that event happens, we‚Äôll set our **EventCreate**‚Äôs `event.category` data equal to the value that was sent up. In this case, the value is whichever `option` was selected. 

Additionally, `v-model` allows us to pass *in* a value as a prop, which is especially useful if our **BaseSelect** needs an initial, existing value fed into it. There‚Äôs just a bit more work we need to do to get that part working correctly.


----------
## Setting an initial option

Our **BaseSelect** component may be used in a form where we need to display an initial value for its selected option. For example, **BaseSelect** might appear in an edit event form, and we need to pass this component the initial `option` value of ‚Äúnature‚Äù so it can display that value as the selected option. 

To achieve this, we can add the `selected` attribute to our component‚Äôs `option` element, and within it perform a conditional check to see if the `option` is equal to the initial `value`, like so: 

üìÉ **src/components/BaseSelect.vue**
```html
    <option
      v-for="option in options"
      :value="option"
      :key="option"
      :selected="option === value" <!-- perform conditional check -->
    >{{ option }}</option>
```
Now, when this component loads, since it received `"nature"` as the initial `value`, it will display that as the selected option, like so:


![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578383810384_0.png?alt=media&token=3a12799e-c83a-4f1a-b41d-a0f55b4e3deb)


Now our **BaseSelect** works as its own standalone component that we can use and reuse throughout our app‚Äôs forms. 


üìÉ **src/components/BaseSelect.vue**
```javascript
    <template>
      <div>
        <label v-if="label">{{ label }}</label>
        <select :value="value" 
                @change="updateValue" 
                v-bind="$attrs">
          <option v-for="option in options"
                  :value="option" 
                  :key="option"
                  :selected="option === value"
                  >
                  {{ option }}
          </option>
        </select>
      </div>
    </template>
    
    <script>
    export default {
      inheritAttrs: false,
      props: {
        options: {
          type: Array,
          required: true
        },
        value: [String, Number],
        label: String
      },
      methods: {
        updateValue(event) {
          this.$emit('input', event.target.value)
        }
      }
    }
    </script>
```

----------
## Getting more complex

While **BaseSelect** will work if our `options` are primitive data types, such as strings or integers, what if our our `options` were an array of objects? Or what if we needed the ability to select multiple options, not just one?

For more complex selecting components, we recommend exploring [vue-multiselect](https://vue-multiselect.js.org/). This is a robust library created and maintained by Core Vue Team Member Damian Dulisz.
