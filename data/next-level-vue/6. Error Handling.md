# Error Handling

It‚Äôs inevitable that people will end up navigating to pages on our website that don‚Äôt exist or used to exist.  In our event application let‚Äôs figure out how to deal with this and also when we navigate to events that do not exist.

## üõë Problem: The Generic Not Found 404

Right now when I go to a URL that doesn‚Äôt exist I get a blank page with no information about what is going on.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Solution: A Not Found Component

Let‚Äôs create a generic Not Found Component that we‚Äôll redirect to when a path is accessed that doesn‚Äôt exist.

üìÉ **/src/views/NotFound.vue**
```html
    <template>
      <div>
        <h1>Oops!</h1>
        <h3>The page you're looking for is not here.
        </h3>
        <router-link :to="{ name: 'event-list' }">Back to the home page</router-link>
      </div>  
    </template>
```
Now we need to render this component when we go to a catch-all route, by updating our router.js file:

üìÉ **/src/router.js**
```javascript
    import NotFound from './views/NotFound.vue'
    ...
    const router = new Router({
      mode: 'history',
      routes: [
        ...
        {
          path: '/404',
          name: '404',
          component: NotFound,
        },
        { // Here's the new catch all route
          path: '*',
          redirect: { name: '404' }
        }
      ]
    })
```
As you can see, we‚Äôre creating a 404 path and name which loads our NotFound component, and then we are redirecting to the 404 path when we hit our new catch-all route.  

There is a reason we‚Äôre redirecting to our 404 page (rather than just rendering the component), which will become clear in a minute.  Now when we load up a path that doesn‚Äôt exist, like /login, we get:

Looks great!

## üõë Problem: What about when we try to view a non-existent Event?

Right now, when we go to an event that doesn‚Äôt exist, like `/event/1233` we see this:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578372086963_1.jpg?alt=media&token=903aac8b-5280-4845-b356-3429b07b3412)

It‚Äôs not horrible, but nothing renders onto the page except a notification.  A better solution would be to add onto our NotFound component and navigate the user there.  The great part about navigation guards is that we can change where the user is navigating based on a condition (like if the event exists).  Let‚Äôs try it!

## ‚òëÔ∏è Solution: Creating a 404 page for our EventShow

The solution kinda depends on you understanding our EventShow code, so you might want to watch the earlier videos if you start to get lost.

The first thing I‚Äôm going to do to make this work is to remove the `catch` in `fetchEvent`.  We will catch the error further up the chain, and since we return request, we can catch errors up in our router, which we‚Äôll do in a minute.

üìÉ **/src/store/modules/event.js**
```javascript
    ...
      fetchEvent({ commit, getters, dispatch }, id) {
        var event = getters.getEventById(id)
        if (event) {
          commit('SET_EVENT', event)
        } else {
          return EventService.getEvent(id)
            .then(response => {
              commit('SET_EVENT', response.data)
              return response.data
            })  // I just deleted the catch
        }
      }
    }
```
Then in the router I‚Äôm going to catch the error, and use the `next()` function to send navigation straight to the 404 route. 

üìÉ **/src/router.js**
```javascript
    ...
      {
          path: '/event/:id',
          name: 'event-show',
          component: EventShow,
          props: true,
          beforeEnter(routeTo, routeFrom, next) {
            store
              .dispatch('event/fetchEvent', routeTo.params.id)
              .then(event => {
                routeTo.params.event = event
                next()
              })
              .catch(() => next({ name: '404', params: { resource: 'event' } }))
        },  
        {
          path: '/404',
          name: '404',
          component: NotFound,
          props: true // I added this so we can receive the param as a prop
        },
        {
          path: '*',
          redirect: { name: '404', params: { resource: 'page' } }
                                  // I added this resource param here.
        }
    ...
```
You also should notice that I‚Äôm sending a **resource** parameter into our 404 component.  This will allow me to write a more descriptive error message on our 404 page.  In order to receive this param as a prop, I added `props: true` to my 404 path,  added this param to our catch-all route configuration, and now I need to receive that param as an optional prop in my **NotFound** component.

üìÉ **/src/views/NotFound.vue**
```javascript
    <template>
      <div>
        <h1>Oops!</h1>
        <h3>The  
          <template v-if="resource">
            {{ resource }}
          </template>
           page you're looking for is not here.
        </h3>
        <router-link :to="{ name: 'event-list' }">Back to the home page</router-link>
      </div>  
    </template>
    <script>
    export default {
      props: {
        resource: {
          type: String,
          required: true
        }
      }
    }
    </script>
```
As you can see, if there is a resource passed in, then the verbiage is used in the user-friendly error message.  

Now when we go to `http://localhost:8080/event/123` we see:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578372092106_2.jpg?alt=media&token=d01b8004-8e91-4f90-a5ed-2544c2660252)

Great!  Now when people link to events which don‚Äôt exist we have a really nice looking 404 page.  Users hitting this page is inevitable since our users can delete events.

## üõë Problem: Errors won't always be 404

The only issue with this solution is that we're assuming all network errors we receive are 404 errors. However, what if the user's Internet just died or they're on a super slow connection? We don't want to give them a 404 error if their Internet dies, but that's what's going to happen right now, so let's fix this.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Solution: A NetworkIssue component

We'll start by creating a new component:

üìÉ **/src/pages/NetworkIssue.vue**
```html
    <template>
      <div>
        <h1>Uh-Oh!</h1>
        <h3>It looks you're experiencing some network issues, please click the back button and try again.</h3>
    
        <router-link :to="{ name: 'event-list' }">Or go back to the event list</router-link>
      </div>  
    </template>
```
We'll add a simple route to our router:

üìÉ **/src/router.js**
```javascript
        {
          path: '/network-issue',
          name: 'network-issue',
          component: NetworkIssue
        },
```
Then in the router we need to check for the 404 error response from the API server, and send our response to the appropriate page.

üìÉ **/src/router.js**
```javascript
              .catch(error => {
                if (error.response && error.response.status == 404) {
                  next({
                    name: '404',
                    params: { resource: 'event' }
                  })
                } else {
                  next({ name: 'network-issue' })
                }
              })
```
Also, in EventService, let's set a timeout, so that if our browser waits longer than 15 seconds for the API request to return, it'll automatically throw an error that will lead to our NetworkIssue component.

üìÉ **/src/services/EventService.vue**
```javascript
    const apiClient = axios.create({
      baseURL: `http://localhost:3000`,
      withCredentials: false, // This is the default
      headers: {
        Accept: 'application/json',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      timeout: 15000
    })
```
Now if our API server goes down or takes too long to return, our users will get a network error rather than just getting a webpage that loads forever!  See below for the improvements we just made:

## ‚è™ Let‚Äôs Review

In this lesson we learned how to create a catch-all error page when the URL doesn‚Äôt match any of our routes.  We then showed how to create a 404 Not Found page when the user navigates to an event that doesn‚Äôt exist, and then how to filter out those 404 errors from other network errors.
