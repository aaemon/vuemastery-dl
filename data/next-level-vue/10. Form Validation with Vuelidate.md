# Form Validation with Vuelidate

A form is only as good as the data it collects from your user. If it’s not collecting what you need, your form isn’t serving its purpose. This is why we need form validation. In this tutorial, we’ll be exploring how to add validation to Vue forms.


----------
## **🛑** Problem

Currently, if a user fills out our **EventCreate** form, they are able to leave fields blank and still submit the form. We don’t want that to happen. We need to make sure those fields are filled in, and with the right kind of information.


## **☑️** Solution: Vuelidate

While it’s possible to write all of your form validation from scratch, fortunately we don’t need to do that. There are already quality libraries that can help with that, and we’ll be using one of them in this lesson. [Vuelidate](https://monterail.github.io/vuelidate/) is a popular and lightweight validation library created by [Paweł Grabarz](https://twitter.com/frizi09) and [Damian Dulisz](https://twitter.com/DamianDulisz), who is a member of the Vue core team. It’s also quite flexible and can scale with you as your app, and its validation needs, grows.

We’ll install Vuelidate by running this command in our terminal:

```
    npm install vuelidate --save
```
To get started using it, we’ll head to our **main.js** file, and import vuelidate here and tell `Vue` to `use` it.

📃 **src/main.js**
```javascript
    ...
    import Vuelidate from 'vuelidate'
    
    Vue.use(Vuelidate)
    ...
```
Now we can use Vuelidate globally throughout our app. 

----------
## Getting Started with Vuelidate

In the next lesson we’ll look at implementing Vuelidate in our example app’s form (within **EventCreate**). But for now, we’re going to get started learning about validation with a simpler example. 

📃 **Example.vue**
```javascript
    <template>
      <div>
        <input type="email" placeholder="What's your email" v-model="email"/>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </div>
    </template>
    
    <script>
    export default {
      data() {
        return {
          email: null
        }
      }
    }
    </script>
```
As you can see, in the template we have an `input` to collect a user’s email, which is bound with `v-model` to this component’s `email` data. 

In order to start validating this, we’ll add a `validations` option to our component. This option isn’t something provided to us by Vuelidate; it’s just an option we’re adding, which Vuelidate can make use of.

📃 **Example.vue**
```javascript
    <script>
    export default {
      data() {
        return {
          email: null
        }
      },
      validations: { <!-- new option here -->
        email: {}
      }
    }
    </script>
```
Within the `validations` option, we can write `email`, which refers to our `email` data. This allows us to start validating that value. So how do we want to validate it? Well we want it to be *required*, and we also want to make sure it actually *is* an email. So we’ll import `required` and `email` from Vuelidate. These are built-in Vuelidate validators. The email validator contains a regular expression that makes sure the input value is an actual email.

Now let’s add those validators to our `validations` option within the `email` property.

📃 **Example.vue**
```javascript
    <template>
      <div>
        <input type="email" placeholder="What's your email" v-model="email"/>
        <button type="submit">Submit!</button>
      </div>
    </template>
    
    <script>
    import { required, email } from 'vuelidate/lib/validators'
    
    export default {
      data() {
        return {
          email: null
        }
      },
      validations: {
        email: {
          required,
          email
        }
      }
    }
    </script>
```

----------
## Checking the Browser

Now let’s check this out in the browser, and look at the Vue DevTools. We can see that Vuelidate has added a computed property called `$v`. If we look inside, we’ll see it contains the current state of our validations. What we’re really concerned about here is the email object since that contains the state of our `email` validations. 

So let’s open that up:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370200459_0.png?alt=media&token=8b76e7ee-93e3-43fe-a09c-27d372485452)<!--{.img-300}-->


Inside, we can see that `$invalid` is `true`. That’s because Vuelidate has already started validating our form. If we look at `required` we’ll see that it’s `false`. We want that to be `true`, but since there’s currently nothing input in our email field, `required` will be `false` until the field contains a value. 

We can also see the value of `email` is `true`. That’s because no one has typed into the email field, so Vuelidate has nothing to check its regular expression against to determine if the input value is an email or not. Let’s start typing into the input and watch what happens.


![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370200460_1.png?alt=media&token=2ce112e2-2ad2-4be9-b929-6d6e51b68a31)


If I type “adam”, `required` turns `true` since we now have a value in the field, but `email` has turned `false`, as it should since the string “adam” is not a valid email. Because our email is not valid, our `$invalid` state is `true`. 

But if I continue typing and write “adam@gmail.com” our validation states will change.


![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370206970_2.png?alt=media&token=e1e1346a-678a-43fc-b252-3b477ec525c3)


`email` is now `true` since I’ve typed a valid email, and since the field is not blank, `required` is also `true`. With no invalid states, `$invalid` is now `false`. 

Perfect. We’re starting to understand how and when Vuelidate is validating our form. But when these state changes are happening, and there’s problems with our form, we aren’t letting our user know. So let’s start displaying messages that alert the user when the form is invalid.


----------
## Letting Our User Know

By checking `$v.email.email` we can access a boolean for whether the input value is an actual email or not. If it’s not an email (e.g. `false`), we can display an error, telling the user to enter a valid email.

📃 **Example.vue**
```html
    <p v-if="!$v.email.email">Please enter a valid email address.</p>
```
Since this is a required field, we also can’t have the user leaving this blank. We can use `$v.email.$required` to display an error message when the field is left blank, with this `v-if`:

📃 **Example.vue**
```html
    <p v-if="!$v.email.required">Email is required.</p>
```
Notice how in both of these `v-if` directives, we’re using `!`. In other words, we’re saying if there is *not* a valid email or there is *not* any value input, we’ll display these error messages.

Now let’s check this out in the browser. 


![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370209769_3.png?alt=media&token=98cea97e-5ebb-4c25-807f-c0119bd02d9e)


When this component first loads, we immediately see the “Email is required” message because `$v.email.required` is `false`. So far so good. What happens when we start typing?


![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370212524_4.png?alt=media&token=bad9040e-80ce-458c-be2c-f994c98c51be)


As I type “adam”, the “Email is required” message goes away since `$v.email.required` turned `true` and “Please enter a valid email” shows up since `$v.email.email` is now `false`.  

If I keep typing out a complete email, “Please enter a valid email” goes away and `$invalid` turns `false`. If I delete everything I just typed, I’ll get “Email is required” again since that will have caused `$v.email.required` to be `false` again.

Great. We’re now effectively displaying errors to our user when there’s problems on our form. But it’s not a great user experience to be displaying the ”Email is required” error message automatically. Imagine if our form had 12 fields and each one was displaying an obnoxious ”___________ is required” message. If I found a form like that, I’d be like give me a chance to fill this out before telling me I’ve done something wrong. 

So we can hide that ”Email is required” error message until something happens. What do we want to happen before we display that message? Well, we can give the user a chance to fill it out before telling them it’s required. In other words, if a user touches the form then clicks away, we can let them know that it’s required.

Fortunately, there’s a name for that: When a user focuses on an element and then focuses away from it. It’s called `blur`. So we can listen for the `blur` event on our input. 

📃 **Example.vue**
```html
    <input
      type="email"
      placeholder="What's your email"
      v-model.trim="email" <!-- trimming off any whitespace -->
      @blur="??" <!-- listening for blur events, but then what? -->
    >
```
So the question now is: What do we want to trigger when the `blur` event happens? 

The way Vuelidate works, validations are run on each change, as we observed earlier. But in order for the `$error` state to be `true`, a field needs to be both `$dirty` and `$invalid`. So we need to be triggering the `$dirty` state to be `true` after a user has interacted with the field so that we can make this field have an `$error`. We then can use that `$error` state to our advantage, as we’ll see in a minute.

But what does it mean for a field to be `$dirty`? That term just means the field has been interacted with, or in other words: touched. We can imagine that once it’s been clicked on or input into, that it’s now *dirty* with the fingerprint of our user. So in order to change the state of this field to `$dirty`, we can trigger Vuelidate’s `touch` method on `blur`, like so:

📃 **Example.vue**
```html
    <input
      type="email"
      placeholder="What's your email"
      v-model.trim="email"
      @blur="$v.email.$touch()" <!-- triggering the $dirty state on blur -->
    >
```
Now once a user has focused on this input, then focused away from it, the `$dirty` state will be true, and if the field is also blank, then `$v.email.required` will be `false`, which means the field is `$invalid`. Again, the way Vuelidate works, if a field is both `$dirty` and `$invalid` then that means there is an `$error`. 

So now we can use this `$error` state to our advantage. We can wrap our error messages in a div, and only display that div once it is `true` that there is an `$error` on this field.

📃 **Example.vue**
```html
    <div v-if="$v.email.$error"> <!-- hides messages until field has error -->
      <p class="errorMessage" v-if="!$v.email.email">Please enter a valid email address.</p>
      <p class="errorMessage" v-if="!$v.email.required">Email is required.</p>
    </div>
```
Great. Now when this component first loads, our error messages will be hidden until an `$error` occurs, which means the user has actually `touch`ed the field and left it blank, or input an incorrect value. 


----------
## Error Styling

To improve our user interface and clarify where errors are occurring, we can add some error-based styling. 

Let’s add a class of `errorMessage` to our error messages, which will color them red.

```html
    <div v-if="$v.email.$error">
      <p v-if="!$v.email.email" class="errorMessage">Please enter a valid email address.</p>
      <p v-if="!$v.email.$error" class="errorMessage">Email is required.</p>
    </div>
```
It would be even more clear for our users where an error is if an error-ridden input field also appeared red. We can achieve that by binding an `error` class to our input element whenever there is an error associated with that field.

📃 **Example.vue**
```html
    <input
      type="email"
      placeholder="What's your email"
      :class="{ error: $v.email.$error }" <!-- added error class binding -->
      v-model="email"
      @blur="$v.email.$touch()" 
    >
```
With `:class="{ error: $v.email.$error }``"`, our class of `error` will be applied whenever that field contains validation errors. `error` is simply a global style that adds a red border around the input element.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370215152_5.png?alt=media&token=a509ebfc-6c8a-4180-b626-696b3aa61383)<!--{.img-500}-->


By the way, `error` and `errorMessage` are both global classes. 


----------
## Disabling Our Button

If our form does have any errors, we probably don’t want our user being able to click our submit button. So let’s disable that whenever the form is invalid.

If we open the Vue DevTools again in the browser, and take a look higher up in our `$v` computed property, we’ll see there are some more validation states we can make use of for this purpose.

`$v.$invalid` will be `true` whenever there are any errors associated with our validations. So we’ll apply the `disabled` attribute to the button whenever that’s the case.

```html
    <button type="submit" :disabled="$v.$invalid">Submit</button>
```
Below the button, let’s also display a message when the form needs more work, by using the `$anyError` state, like this:

📃 **Example.vue**
```html
    <p v-if="$v.$anyError" class="errorMessage">Please fill out the required field(s).</p>
```
Now if the form has errors, the button will be disabled, and the user will be told to fill out the required fields, which should be outlined in red and accompanied by their respective red error messages.


![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370219449_6.png?alt=media&token=2c24a221-df62-4eb7-a441-1e81b1b5bc0c)<!--{.img-500}-->

----------
## Validating Upon Submit

A common way to validate forms is to check their validity before submission. You can accomplish this easily by checking for the `$invalid` state before submitting the form.

So we change out the `div` wrapping this component for a `form` element, and add `@submit.prevent="submit"` on the opening tag.

📃 **Example.vue**
```html
    <template>
      <form @submit.prevent="submit">
        <input
          type="email"
          placeholder="What's your email"
          v-model="email"
          :class="{ error: $v.email.$error }"
          @blur="$v.email.$touch()"
        >
        <div v-if="$v.email.$error">
          <p v-if="!$v.email.email" class="errorMessage">Please enter a valid email</p>
          <p v-if="!$v.email.required" class="errorMessage">Email is required</p>
        </div>
        <button :disabled="$v.$invalid" type="submit">Submit</button>
        <p v-if="$v.$anyError" class="errorMessage">Please fill out the required fields</p>
      </form>
    </template>
```
Now let’s add a `submit` method to this example component.

📃 **Example.vue**
```javascript
    methods: {
      submit() {
        this.$v.$touch()
        if (!this.$v.$invalid) {
          console.log('Form Submission:', this.email)
        }
      }
    }
```
Inside here, we’re calling `$touch()` again, which will change the `$dirty` status on all form validations, causing `$error` to be `true` for all `$invalid` fields. 

If our form is valid (`!this.$v.$invalid`), we’ll submit the form. In our example’s case, we’re just logging the `email` to the console. 


![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370219450_7.png?alt=media&token=df837435-e248-405c-a69a-816035993ef4)


Awesome! It works. Here is the code in its entirety:

📃 **Example.vue**
```javascript
    <template>
      <form @submit.prevent="submit">
        <input
          type="email"
          placeholder="What's your email"
          :class="{ error: $v.email.$error }"
          v-model.trim="email"
          @blur="$v.email.$touch()"
        >
          <p v-if="!$v.email.email" class="errorMessage">Please enter a valid email address.</p>
          <p v-if="!$v.email.required" class="errorMessage">Email is required.</p>
      
        <button type="submit" :disabled="$v.$invalid">Submit!</button>
      </form>
      
    </template>
    <script>
    import { required, email } from 'vuelidate/lib/validators'
    export default {
      data() {
        return {
          email: null
        }
      },
      validations: {
        email: {
          required,
          email
        }
      },
      methods: {
        submit() {
          this.$v.$touch()
          if (!this.$v.$invalid) {
            console.log('Form Submission:', this.email)
          }
        }
      }
    }
    </script>
```

## More than one way to skin this cat 🐱 

With this introduction to validating our forms with [Vuelidate](https://monterail.github.io/vuelidate/#getting-started), you should now feel comfortable starting to use this helpful library for your use cases. The solution demonstrated in this lesson is one of many implementations that are available to you with this flexible library. Additionally, you are not limited to the built-in validators that Vuelidate provides for you. You can also write your own [custom validators](https://monterail.github.io/vuelidate/#custom-validators). 


----------
## What’s next?

In the next lesson, we’ll look at adding Vuelidate validations to our reusable form components.
