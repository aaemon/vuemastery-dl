# Form Validation with Vuelidate Pt. 2

NOTE: Since publishing this lesson, we've learned there is a new issue with vuejs-datepicker's `opened` event. If you are experiencing issues getting the code to work on that component, please know it's likely due to this issue.

In our [previous lesson](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/next-level-vue/form-validation-with-vuelidate), we started working with Vuelidate to validate a Vue form. In this lesson, we’ll continue working with Vuelidate and add validations to our example application’s form, which is composed of our reusable form components.


----------
## 🛑 Problem 

Inside our **EventCreate** component, we have a form that is currently able to be submitted with blank fields. We don’t want users to be able to create an event without filling out all the fields for the information an event needs.


## ✅ Solution: Vuelidate EventCreate

We can use Vuelidate to validate each field of our **EventCreate** form so that it can only be submitted if the user has input the information the form needs. Since we already installed Vuelidate in the previous lesson and imported it within our **main.js** file, we can start validating our EventCreate form. 

Let’s import the `required` validator into this file from Vuelidate’s library of validators.

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```javascript
    import { required } from 'vuelidate/lib/validators'
```
Then we can add a `validations` option to this component, below its data.

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```javascript
    validations: {},
```
What are we validating? We need to validate everything the user enters when they create an event, which includes these properties on our event data: `category`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `date`, and `time`. Specifically, these all need to be `required`. 

Since these properties are all nested within `event`, we can add them to the `validations` option and make them `required` like so:

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```javascript
    validations: {
      event: {
        category: { required },
        title: { required },
        description: { required },
        location: { required },
        date: { required },
        time: { required }
      }
    },
```

----------
## Validating Each Field

We can now start adding the necessary code to validate each field. For each field (which will be composed by our **BaseSelect** and **BaseInput** components), we’ll need to do the following:


1. Add an error message that can be conditionally displayed when that field is not filled in
2. Listen for a `blur` event, which triggers Vuelidate’s `$touch` method, giving us an `$error` state we can use.
3. Use the `$error` state to conditionally show the div that contains our error message (from step 1).
4. Add error styling to our field and its error message

Now that we know what needs to be done, let’s start validating our first field.


----------
## Validating Category

To start validating our category field, which is composed with our **BaseSelect** component, we’ll create an error message that will be conditionally displayed if our `category` field is not filled out (`!$v.event.category.required`).

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <BaseSelect
      label="Select a category"
      :options="categories"
      v-model="event.category"
    />
    <p v-if="!$v.event.category.required" class="errorMessage">Category is required.</p>
```
So far so good, but remember from the last lesson: we don’t want to display this error message until the user has already interacted with the field, and left it blank. 

So we can be listening for the `blur` event on **BaseSelect**, which will trigger Vuelidate’s `$touch` method. This will turn the `category`  field’s `$dirty` state to `true`. 

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <BaseSelect
      label="Select a category"
      :options="categories"
      v-model="event.category"
      @blur="$v.event.category.$touch()" <!-- triggers dirty status -->
    />
```
As we learned in the last lesson, if a Vuelidate field is both `$dirty` and `$invalid`, then it has an `$error` state of `true`. So when our field is *touched* and left blank, it will be both `$dirty` and `$invalid`, giving us an `$error` state of true. We can use this `$error` state to conditionally display a container that contains our error message.

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <BaseSelect
      label="Select a category"
      :options="categories"
      v-model="event.category"
      @blur="$v.event.category.$touch()" 
    />
    <template v-if="$v.event.category.$error"> <!-- displays when error is true -->
      <p v-if="!$v.event.category.required" class="errorMessage">Category is required.</p>
    </template>
```
We’ll also want to color our input field red, so we’ll add a class to that field with class binding, using that same `$error` state.

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <BaseSelect
      label="Select a category"
      :options="categories"
      v-model="event.category"
      :class="{ error: $v.event.category.$error}" <!-- add class when $error is true -->
      @blur="$v.event.category.$touch()"
    />
    <template v-if="$v.event.category.$error">
      <p v-if="!$v.event.category.required" class="errorMessage">Category is required.</p>
    </template>
```
Now this all should work, right? Let’s check the browser to make sure. We’ll focus on the the category field, then click away from it (blur), and our error message and styling should appear.

But wait… nothing is happening. The error message isn’t showing up. What’s going on here? 

Well, we’ve added that `blur` event listener to **BaseSelect,** but we haven’t given the native `select` element inside of **BaseSelect** the ability to inherit that event listener. Fortunately this is an easy fix.

Remember when we created our **BaseButton** in a [previous lesson](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/next-level-vue/Reusable-Form-Components-BaseButton)? We added `v-on="$listeners"` to the native `button` element within it so that it could inherit the event listeners added in the parent scope. We can do the same thing and add `v-on="$listeners"` to our **BaseSelect** component’s `select` element so it can inherit the `blur` event listener.

📃 **src/components/BaseSelect.vue**
```html
    <template>
      <div>
        <label v-if="label">{{ label }}</label>
        <select :value="value" v-on="$listeners" @change="updateValue" v-bind="$attrs"> <!-- now inheriting event listeners here -->
          <option
            v-for="option in options"
            :value="option"
            :key="option.id"
            :selected="option === value"
          >{{ option }}</option>
        </select>
      </div>
    </template>
```
Now if we save and check this out in the browser, we should be seeing the error message show up. 


![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578372263507_1.png?alt=media&token=81b7e330-83f8-4cee-adb3-e3a68e23d03c)


Great it’s working. While we’re validating this select field, let’s validate the other field that is using our **BaseSelect** component: the `times` field.


----------
## Validating Times

To validate our `times` field, everything will stay the same conceptually. And since we already added the `$listeners` fix that our **BaseSelect** component needed, we just need to replicate what we did in **EventCreate** for the `category` field, like so:

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <BaseSelect
      label="Select a time"
      :options="times"
      v-model.trim="event.time"
      class="field"
      :class="{ error: $v.event.time.$error}"
      @blur="$v.event.time.$touch()"
    />
    <template v-if="$v.event.time.$error">
      <p v-if="!$v.event.time.required" class="errorMessage">Time is required.</p>
    </template>
```
Now let’s continue down the form and start validating our first text input field.


----------
## Validating Title

To validate our title field, we’re going to repeat the same steps we just did above and end up with:

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <BaseInput
      label="Title"
      placeholder="Title"
      type="text"
      class="field"
      :class="{ error: $v.event.title.$error }"
      v-model.trim="event.title"
      @blur="$v.event.title.$touch()"
    />
    <template v-if="$v.event.title.$error">
      <p v-if="!$v.event.title.required" class="errorMessage">Title is required.</p>
    </template>
```
We’ll also make sure to inherit the `blur` event listener and all other potential listeners on the `input` element of **BaseInput,** just like we did with **BaseSelect**’s select element.

📃 **src/components/BaseInput.vue**
```html
    <template>
      <div>
        <label v-if="label">{{ label }}</label>
        <input :value="value" v-bind="$attrs" v-on="$listeners" @input="updateValue">
      </div>
    </template>
```
Now let’s test this out in the browser. We’ll focus on the field, then click away from it, which should trigger our error message and styling.


![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578372276475_2.png?alt=media&token=ce9d0cd5-67e4-4dff-9e5a-272d60838922)


Great it’s working so far. But when we actually try to input a title here, we get this weird `[object InputEvent]` showing up.


![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578372276476_3.png?alt=media&token=a236929d-60f0-48aa-88bd-11c5040728c7)


Oh geez… what’s going on here? The reason for this strange behavior is a bit complicated to grasp, so let’s tackle this piece by piece.

We have `v-model` on our BaseInput:

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <BaseInput
      label="Title"
      placeholder="Title"
      type="text"
      class="field"
      :class="{ error: $v.event.title.$error }"
      v-model="event.title" <!-- right here -->
      @blur="$v.event.title.$touch()"
    />
```
As we covered in [our lesson](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/next-level-vue/reusable-form-components-baseinput) where we built **BaseInput**, `v-model` is really just syntactic sugar. In this case, `v-model="event.title"` translates to:

```html
    :value="event.title"
    @input="(value) => { event.title = value }"
```
Why is this important? Well, this means we have a *listener* here for the `input` event. And since we just added `v-on="$listeners"` that means we are inheriting that `input` event listener onto our **BaseInput’s** input element.

```html
    <input :value="value" v-bind="$attrs" @input="updateValue" v-on="$listeners">
```
And why is *that* important? Well, look again at what’s on that element. We’ve also got `@input="updateValue"`. That means we have two `input` event listeners. One that is triggering the `updateValue` method, and one that we’re inheriting from the parent scope, which is hidden under the sugar-coating of our `v-model`. This means we have a conflict, and the second `input` (the one from the `v-model`) is taking precedence.

Okay so we know what caused this funky behavior. But how do we fix it? Take a few deep breaths, because the solution to this problem is as convoluted as the issue that caused it. 🧘‍♀️🧘‍♂️


----------
## Resolving Our Conflict

If two people are in conflict about something, what’s a good way to resolve that? How about they shake hands and compromise? What does this have to do with our code? Well, that’s basically what we’re about to implement: a compromise. We can encapsulate that compromise within a computed property, which we’ll call `listeners`.

📃 **src/components/BaseInput.vue**
```javascript
    computed: {
      listeners() {
        return {
          ...this.$listeners,
          input: this.updateValue
        }
      }
    }
```
Since both of our `input` events want to exist but they’re currently messing with each other, the compromise is: they can both exist alongside each other within a `listeners` object, which our computed property returns. Notice how we’re using the object spread operator to merge the inherited `$listeners` into this object (i.e. the `input` event listener hidden in `v-model`), and below that is a property for our `input` event that triggers the `updateValue` method.

Since there are now two `input` definitions on this object. Because of the way JavaScript objects work, the one that is defined last will take precedence. In this case, the `input` event that triggers our `updateValue` method takes precedence, which solves our issue!

Now, in the template, we can simply add our computed `listeners` to the `input` element.

📃 **src/components/BaseInput.vue**
```html
    <input :value="value" v-bind="$attrs" v-on="listeners">
```
Now we should have everything working. Let’s check it out in the browser.


![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578372281723_4.png?alt=media&token=a2f7e25c-99d2-4e89-981d-a9154d499888)


Phew! 😅 It works. I promise the next couple fields will be a lot easier. Let’s keep going.


----------
## Validating Description & Location

To validate the `description` and `location` fields, all we need to do is replicate what we’ve been doing: add an error message that shows up on `blur` when the field is `invalid`, with proper error styling.

For `description`:

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <BaseInput
      label="Description"
      type="text"
      placeholder="Description"
      class="field"
      :class="{ error: $v.event.description.$error}"
      v-model.trim="event.description"
      @blur="$v.event.description.$touch()"
    />
    <template v-if="$v.event.description.$error">
      <p v-if="!$v.event.description.required" class="errorMessage">Description is required.</p>
    </template>
```
For `location`:

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <BaseInput
      label="Location"
      v-model.trim="event.location"
      type="text"
      placeholder="Location"
      class="field"
      :class="{ error: $v.event.location.$error }"
      @blur="$v.event.location.$touch()"
    />
    <template v-if="$v.event.location.$error">
      <p v-if="!$v.event.location.required" class="errorMessage">Location is required.</p>
    </template>
```
Perfect. Now let’s validate our final field.


----------
## Validating Date

We’ve reached our final field that needs to be validated, which is our `date`. This one is a bit special since we’re using [vuejs-datepicker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuejs-datepicker), a third-party Vue component. But the steps we’ll take are the same.

We’ll add an error message and wrap it in a conditionally displayed template:

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <template v-if="$v.event.date.$error">
      <p v-if="!$v.event.date.required" class="errorMessage">Date is required.</p>
    </template>
```
But instead of triggering Vuelidate’s `$touch` method on `blur`, since that won’t be available to us due to the way this component is written, we’ll instead use vuejs-datepicker’s `opened` event listener. 

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <div class="field">
      <label>Date</label>
      <datepicker
        placeholder="Select a date"
        v-model="event.date"
        @opened="$v.event.date.$touch()" <!-- triggering $touch on opened -->
      />
    </div>
    <template v-if="$v.event.date.$error">
      <p v-if="!$v.event.date.required" class="errorMessage">Date is required.</p>
    </template>
```
This will give us essentially the same behavior as our `blur` did. When a user *opens* this component, `$v.event.date` will be *touched* and therefor `$dirty`. By “open”, we’re referring to when a user clicks on the component and the box opens, allowing for a date to be selected.

Great. Now the last step is to add some dynamic error class binding to this field. This is also a bit unique. Instead of binding to the actual `class` attribute, we’ll bind to `input-class`, which is a prop provided to us by vuejs-datepicker. 

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <div class="field">
      <label>Date</label>
      <datepicker
        placeholder="Select a date"
        v-model="event.date"
        @opened="$v.event.date.$touch()"
        :input-class="{ error: $v.event.date.$error }" <!-- binding error class -->
      />
    </div>
    <template v-if="$v.event.date.$error">
      <p v-if="!$v.event.date.required" class="errorMessage">Date is required.</p>
    </template>
```
Now let’s test this out in the browser by opening the component, but not selecting a date.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578372285058_5.png?alt=media&token=5c32aae1-0447-40d6-99f7-5c5fa6fd5d93)


Awesome - it’s working. We’re getting the appropriate error styling on our `date` field.

If you continue using this datepicker component and need to manipulate it in ways we haven’t covered yet, check out [the docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuejs-datepicker), as they are pretty helpful for figuring out what unique code might be needed to achieve your implementation. As you’ll see in the “Events” section, there is also a “closed” event. That would have been even closer to replicating the `blur` event; however, when we tried using that, it didn’t work for us and we discovered there’s an ongoing issue with it. So we are going with `opened` instead, which works for our needs.

Now that all of our individual fields are being validating, we can think through what should happen which this form is submitted.


----------
## Validating On Submit

In the previous lesson, we didn’t want the user to click the submit button on an error-ridden form. That same rule applies here. So we can prevent users from submitting our **EventCreate** form by disabling the button whenever there are any validation errors.

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <BaseButton
      type="submit"
      buttonClass="-fill-gradient"
      :disabled="$v.$anyError" <!-- disable button when error(s) -->
    >Submit</BaseButton>
```
Now, if a user tries to submit the form while it has errors, they’ll be met with a disabled button and error messages. We can also add an error message below the button, telling them to fill out the required field(s).

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <p v-if="$v.$anyError" class="errorMessage">Please fill out the required field(s).</p>
```
Finally, in our `methods` below, we’ll be calling `$touch()` at the top of our `createEvent` method, which is what runs the logic that submits the form. This will ensure that all fields are turned `$dirty` so that any `$errors` can be found (and displayed).

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```javascript
    createEvent() {
      this.$v.$touch() // "touching" all fields to turn them "dirty"
      if (!this.$v.$invalid) { // submit form only when all fields are valid
        NProgress.start()
        this.$store
          .dispatch('event/createEvent', this.event)
          .then(() => {
            this.$router.push({
              name: 'event-show',
              params: { id: this.event.id }
            })
            this.event = this.createFreshEventObject()
          })
          .catch(() => {
            NProgress.done()
          })
      }
```
Great! Now our user can’t submit the form until every `required` field has been filled out, and our users will receive helpful error messages related to the fields they still need to complete. 


----------
## Let’s ReVue

We did it! Now our **EventCreate** form is guaranteed to only be submitted when it has the information it needs. Hopefully you now feel more comfortable with the concept of form validation, and can start using Vuelidate to empower your Vue apps. 


----------
## The Complete Code

In case you need it, here’s the full **EventCreate.vue** code:

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```javascript
    <template>
      <div>
        <h1>Create an Event</h1>
        <form @submit.prevent="createEvent">
          <BaseSelect
            label="Select a category"
            :options="categories"
            v-model="event.category"
            :class="{ error: $v.event.category.$error}"
            @blur="$v.event.category.$touch()"
          />
          <template v-if="$v.event.category.$error">
            <p v-if="!$v.event.category.required" class="errorMessage">Category is required.</p>
          </template>
          
          <h3>Name & describe your event</h3>
          <BaseInput
            label="Title"
            placeholder="Title"
            type="text"
            class="field"
            :class="{ error: $v.event.title.$error}"
            v-model.trim="event.title"
            @blur="$v.event.title.$touch()"
          />
          <template v-if="$v.event.title.$error">
            <p v-if="!$v.event.title.required" class="errorMessage">Title is required.</p>
          </template>
          <BaseInput
            label="Description"
            type="text"
            placeholder="Description"
            class="field"
            :class="{ error: $v.event.description.$error}"
            v-model.trim="event.description"
            @blur="$v.event.description.$touch()"
          />
          <template v-if="$v.event.description.$error">
            <p v-if="!$v.event.description.required" class="errorMessage">Description is required.</p>
          </template>
          
          <h3>Where is your event?</h3>
          <BaseInput
            label="Location"
            v-model.trim="event.location"
            type="text"
            placeholder="Location"
            class="field"
            :class="{ error: $v.event.location.$error }"
            @blur="$v.event.location.$touch()"
          />
          <template v-if="$v.event.location.$error">
            <p v-if="!$v.event.location.required" class="errorMessage">Location is required.</p>
          </template>
          
          <h3>When is your event?</h3>
          <div class="field">
            <label>Date</label>
            <datepicker
              placeholder="Select a date"
              v-model="event.date"
              @opened="$v.event.date.$touch()"
              :input-class="{ error: $v.event.date.$error }"
            />
          </div>
          <template v-if="$v.event.date.$error">
