# Completing our Progress Bar

In the previous lesson we learned how to use Global Route Guards and per-route Guards to implement our progress bar when we show events using the **EventShow** component.  Now let‚Äôs build upon that to get the progress bar working with **EventList** and **EventCreate**.  Both require slightly different implementations.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem: We need EventList to use our Progress Bar

At the moment our **EventList** looks like this:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578372117882_0.gif?alt=media&token=5e9d3fab-8def-4738-a760-513badde418b)

As you can see our progress bar starts and finishes instantly, which is not what we want.  We want our progress bar to run and finish when our API call is returned and the data is loaded into the template.

In order to do this, there are a few things we need to do:

1. Refactor the **perPage** variable into our state.  
2. Modify the **router.js** file
3. Use **beforeRouteEnter** and **beforeRouteUpdate** in the **EventList** component.

## Step 1: We need **perPage** to be in the state

We needed some way to keep track of how many events to display per page, and previously we used a local constant called **perPage** in our **EventList** component.  

Declaring `this.perPage = 3` in our `created()` lifecycle hook added **perPage** as a local constant we could access in other methods (like `hasNextPage()`).  

See below, this is the current state of our **EventList.vue:**

üìÉ **/src/views/EventList.vue**
```javascript
    <script>
    import EventCard from '@/components/EventCard.vue'
    import { mapState } from 'vuex'
    
    export default {
      components: {
        EventCard
      },
      created() {
        this.perPage = 3 
        
        this.$store.dispatch('event/fetchEvents', {
          perPage: this.perPage,
          page: this.page
        })
      },
      computed: {
        page() {
          return parseInt(this.$route.query.page) || 1
        },
        hasNextPage() {
          return this.event.eventsTotal > this.page * this.perPage
        },
        ...mapState(['event', 'user'])
      }
    }
    </script>
```
In a minute we‚Äôre going to do what we did in the previous lesson inside **EventShow**, where we moved the Vuex Action outside of the `created()` lifecycle hook and into a route guard.  

Since the route guards run before the component is instantiated, `this` does not exist yet.  So, we need to move **perPage** into the Vuex State.  You might think it belongs in the State, and we never should have put it in the component to begin with.  However, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with placing it in either place.

üìÉ **/src/store/modules/event.js**
```javascript
    ...
    export const state = {
      events: [],
      eventsTotal: 0,
      event: {},
      perPage: 3
    }
    ...
    export const actions = {
      ...
      fetchEvents({ commit, dispatch, state }, { page }) {
        return EventService.getEvents(state.perPage, page)
          ...
```
All we changed here is adding **perPage** to the event State with a default of 3, and then we extracted the `state` parameter from the context object, and used the State inside our `getEvent`'s call.  We also added a return to our `EventService` so we can only render our **EventList** component when the API call is finished.  

That‚Äôs our next step:

## Step 2 - Modify the router 

At the moment, our router code looks like this:

üìÉ **/src/router.js**
```javascript
    ...
    const router = new Router({
      mode: 'history',
      routes: [
        {
          path: '/',
          name: 'event-list',
          component: EventList
        },
        ...
```
Here we want to dispatch the `fetchEvents` Action before the component is loaded like we did with **EventShow** with `beforeEnter`.  

With all we‚Äôve learned, you might think the code below would be what we need. However, 
üõë **This won‚Äôt work!**  Take a look at this code below, and then we‚Äôll learn why it won‚Äôt work.

üìÉ **/src/router.js**
```javascript
    ...
    const router = new Router({
      mode: 'history',
      routes: [
        {
          path: '/',
          name: 'event-list',
          component: EventList,
          beforeEnter(routeTo, routeFrom, next) {
            const currentPage = parseInt(routeTo.query.page || 1)
            store
              .dispatch('event/fetchEvents', {
                page: currentPage
              })
              .then(() => {
                ...
```
If I were to use this code to call `fetchEvents` it would only get called when the route is initially loaded.  Then when we hit the next page link, nothing would happen.  ****Our route gets updated when we click on the next page, but since the component is not completely reloaded, `fetchEvents` doesn‚Äôt get called.

So we need another way to ensure `fetchEvents` is called both when the page is navigated to, and when we paginate.  

For now, let‚Äôs finish up the code we need in **router.js** by setting `props: true` because we‚Äôll be setting our current page as a parameter to pass in as a prop.  

üìÉ **/src/router.js**
```javascript
    ...
    const router = new Router({
      mode: 'history',
      routes: [
        {
          path: '/',
          name: 'event-list',
          component: EventList,
          props: true // We'll set the page parameter, so we want to send it in as a prop
        },
        ...
```

## Step 3 - Use **beforeRouteEnter** and **beforeRouteUpdate** in the **EventList** component

From our lesson on In-Component Route guards we learned that **beforeRouteEnter** is called when the component is created and **beforeRouteUpdate** is called when the route changes, but we‚Äôre still using the same component.  This is what we need to ensure `fetchEvents` is called when we paginate.

Since both **beforeRouteEnter** and **beforeRouteUpdate** need to essentially call the same code, I‚Äôm going to extract this duplicate code into a function at the top of our **EventList** component, like so:

üìÉ **/src/views/EventList.vue**
```javascript
    <script>
    import EventCard from '@/components/EventCard.vue'
    import { mapState } from 'vuex'
    import store from '@/store/store'
    
    // Moved the current page & action call outside the component
    function getPageEvents(routeTo, next) {  
      const currentPage = parseInt(routeTo.query.page || 1)
      store
        .dispatch('event/fetchEvents', {
          page: currentPage
        })
        .then(() => {
          // pass it into the component as a prop, so we can print next pages
          routeTo.params.page = currentPage
          next()
        })
    }
    export default {
      props: {
        page: { // current page gets passed in as a prop
          type: Number,
          required: true
        }
      },
      components: {
        EventCard
      },
      beforeRouteEnter(routeTo, routeFrom, next) { // Before we enter the route
        getPageEvents(routeTo, next)
      },
      beforeRouteUpdate(routeTo, routeFrom, next) { // Before we update the route
        getPageEvents(routeTo, next)
      },
      computed: {
        hasNextPage() {
          return this.event.eventsTotal > this.page * this.event.perPage
        },
        ...mapState(['event', 'user'])
      }
    }
    </script>
```
We‚Äôve changed a bunch in this file from before (if you want to look at the before, scroll up). 

First, you‚Äôll notice that we extracted our **currentPage** parsing code and Action call into a function called `getPageEvents`.  We call this function from our `beforeRouteEnter` and `beforeRouteUpdate` route guards. These fire before we enter a route and before we update the route, which solves our problem of our Action only called once with `beforeEnter`.  

You‚Äôll also notice that there‚Äôs now a **page** prop, which contains the current page we‚Äôre on, parsed and passed in through `getPageEvents`.

If we jump into the browser, everything is working as intended:  The Progress bar flows across the top of the screen when we view the event list, and also works when we use the pagination links.

----------
## üòè You might have noticed:

**We didn‚Äôt remove Vuex from the component.**

Before we move on, I want to recognize that we did not remove Vuex from our component code in **EventList,** like we did with **EventShow.**  We certainly could have passed **EventList** all of the props it needed to load through the router, like so:

üìÉ **/src/router.js**
```javascript
    ...
      routes: [
        {
          path: '/',
          name: 'event-list',
          component: EventList,
          props: route => ({
            page: route.params.page,
            perPage: route.params.perPage,
            events: route.params.events,
            eventTotal: route.params.eventTotal
          })
        },
        ...
```

However, we don‚Äôt have to go down this road, and set all these values. We already had to load in Vuex inside **EventList** for `beforeRouteUpdate`  and  `beforeRouteEnter`, so we can keep the Vuex code the same.  

Again, this is a matter of preference.


----------
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Using the Progress Bar with EventCreate

When someone clicks submit on our **EventCreate** page, once again we need to make sure the Progress Bar starts, to ensure a good user experience.  Updating this only requires adding **NProgress** to **EventCreate.**  

Our **EventCreate** currently looks like this:

üìÉ **/src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```javascript
    <script>
    import Datepicker from 'vuejs-datepicker'
    
    export default {
      ...
      methods: {
        createEvent() {
          this.$store
            .dispatch('event/createEvent', this.event)
            .then(() => {
              this.$router.push({
                name: 'event-show',
                params: { id: this.event.id }
              })
              this.event = this.createFreshEventObject()
            })
            .catch(() => { })
        },
        ...
```
We need to do two things here.  We need to start the progress bar before we *dispatch* the event shown here, and we need to stop the progress bar if our Action errors out.

üìÉ **/src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```javascript
    <script>
    import Datepicker from 'vuejs-datepicker'
    import NProgress from 'nprogress' // <--- Include NProgress
    
    export default {
      ...
      methods: {
        createEvent() {
          NProgress.start()  // <-- Start the progress bar
          this.$store
            .dispatch('event/createEvent', this.event)
            .then(() => {
              this.$router.push({
                name: 'event-show',
                params: { id: this.event.id }
              })
              this.event = this.createFreshEventObject()
            })
            .catch(() => {
              NProgress.done() // <-- if errors out stop the progress bar
            })
        },
        ...
```
As you can see, we‚Äôre just starting the NProgress bar and stopping it if we error out.  When the Action is successful, we still use the router to push to the **EventShow** view, just like we were before.  

When our router follows this path it will call `NProgress.start()` again. But since it‚Äôs already running, nothing new will happen and it will finish loading once the **fetchEvent** action is complete. 

Here‚Äôs it working.

## ‚è™ Let‚Äôs Revue

We now finished implementing our progress bar in our example app, and if our API calls ever take a while to return our user interface gives a great user experience.
