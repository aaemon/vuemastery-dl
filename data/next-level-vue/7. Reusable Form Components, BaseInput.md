# Reusable Form Components, BaseInput

In this tutorial, we’re going to learn about reusable form components. We’ll look at how we can take the form we currently have in our example app and break it apart into base form components. I’m assuming you already have an understanding of base and global components, which we covered in [Real World Vue](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/real-world-vue-js/global-components).


----------
## Scaling by Modularizing

If we take a look at our app’s **EventCreate** file, we’ll see there’s a form that is currently constructed with several `input` and `select` elements, along with a `button` to submit it. 

But as our application grows, we could end up with multiple forms implemented by different developers, maybe even different front-end designers, and each one could look and behave differently. In our app, for example, we could eventually have a login form.  

If the different parts of our form were encapsulated inside components, we could create a standard way of displaying input, select, and submit buttons. This way, as our application grows, it has a standardized user experience. Plus our forms would be more predictable, easier to manage, and to debug. 


----------
## Creating a BaseInput 

Let’s start with our `input`, which we’re currently using like this:

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <div class="field">
      <label>Title</label>
      <input v-model="event.title" type="text" placeholder="Add an event title"/>
    </div>
```
Notice we have both `label` and `input` elements, which we’ll keep together in our **BaseInput** component since our `input` will always need a label.

📃 **src/components/BaseInput.vue**
```html
    <template>
      <div class="field">
        <label>Title</label>
        <input v-model="event.title" type="text" placeholder="Add an event title"/>
      </div>
    </template>
```
To make this `label` dynamic, let’s give our **BaseInput** a `label` prop, and bind it to our `label` element and to our `input`.

📃 **src/components/BaseInput.vue**
```html
    <template>
      <div>
        <label v-if="label">{{ label }}</label>
        <input 
          v-model="event.title" 
          type="text" 
          placeholder="Add an event title"
        />
      </div>
    </template>
    
    <script>
    export default {
      props: {
        label: String
      } 
    }
    </script>
```
Now we can pass a `label` into this component, like so: 

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <BaseInput label="Title" />
```
This `label` prop will be used to determine if the `label` element needs to be rendered, and its text will be displayed within our component’s `label` element.


----------
## Handling our Input Value

As you can see with the code so far, we’re still using `v-model="event.title"` on our `input` to bind to the data in **EventCreate.** But `v-model` won’t work here because the **BaseInput** component won’t have its own `event` data. So how we do let our parent (**EventCreate**) know that there’s been a new value input into **BaseInput** component?

We can do this by listening for when a value was input, and then send it up to our parent.

So we can replace the `v-model` with `@input="updateValue"`, which will listen for when a value was input, then trigger the new `updateValue` method.

📃 **src/components/BaseInput.vue**
```html
    <template>
      <div>
        <label v-if="label">{{ label }}</label>
        <input
          :value="value" <!-- binds to our prop -->
          @input="updateValue" <!-- listens for input event and triggers method --> 
          type="text" 
          placeholder="Add an event title"
        />
      </div>
    </template>
    
    <script>
    export default {
      props: {
        value: [String, Number]
        label: String
      },
      methods: {
        updateValue(event) { // <-- method triggered by input event
          this.$emit('input', event.target.value)
        }
      }
    }
    </script>
```
The `updateValue` method allows us to `emit` whatever value was just input, so that our parent can use that value.

Notice how we also added a new prop: `value`. What is that doing there? We want to  be able to take *in* an initial value as a prop, then display it as our `input`'s `value`, hence why we added this to our `input`: 

```html
        <input
          ...
          :value="value" <!-- binds to our value prop --> 
          ...
        />
```
Now, when we actually use our **BaseInput** component, we’ll use `v-model` on it, like so:

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <BaseInput
      label="Title"
      v-model="event.title"
    />
```
Using `v-model` here allows us to bind the `value` (that **BaseInput** *emitted*) to **EventCreate**’s `event` data and also pass that `value` back *in* to our **BaseInput** component. 

If we look at the [documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Using-v-model-on-Components) for `v-model`, we’ll find that `v-model="event.title"` is really just syntactic sugar for:

```html
    :value="event.title"
    @input="(value) => { event.title = value }"
```
In other words, when our **BaseInput** *emits* the `input` event, this triggers a function that takes the payload of that emission (`value`) and sets our **EventCreate**’s `event.title` data equal to it. Then, we’re binding `event.title` to `:value`, which feeds the `value` back *into* **BaseInput** as a prop.

You may be wondering why we’re using this roundabout way of *emitting* the `value` up to the parent, which passes the `value` back in as a prop. Sure, **BaseInput**’s `updateValue` method could’ve just set its own data `value` that the input could be bound to, but firstly, we want to avoid storing local state on these components, which are like the leaves on our component tree. Instead, these leaves can be fed the data they need from components that are closer to the trunk. We want **BaseInput** to behave like an input element, just with added features. It doesn’t need to store it’s own state, just like regular inputs don’t need to do that. Secondly, we want to be able to pass **BaseInput** an initial value.

For example, imagine if we used this **BaseInput** component on the edit view for a user’s profile. We’d want to be able to pass **BaseInput** the user value it needs, such as the user’s email, and use that as the starting `value` of the input field. Having a `value` prop like this allows us to do that.


----------
## Inheriting Attributes

We’re getting closer to making this **BaseInput** a standalone, reusable component. But notice how our `type` and `placeholder` attributes are still on this `input` element: 

📃 **src/components/BaseInput.vue**
```html
    <input
      :value="value"
      @input="updateValue" 
      type="text" <!-- still here -->
      placeholder="Add an event title" <!-- still here -->
    />
```
We could make **BaseInput** more flexible by cutting out these attributes from within the component, and adding them when we actually *use* the component, like so:

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <BaseInput
      v-model="event.title"
      label="Title"
      type="text"
      placeholder="Add an event title"
    />
```
Now these attributes, `type`  and `placeholder`, will be inherited by the **BaseInput** component. But there’s a problem with inheriting attributes like this. When we do so, those attributes are inherited by the root element, in this case the `div` that wraps everything:

📃 **src/components/BaseInput.vue**
```html
    <template>
      <div> <!-- this is where attributes will be inherited -->
        <label v-if="label">{{ label }}</label>
        <input
          :value="value"
          @input="updateValue" 
        />
      </div>
    </template>
```
However, we can add an option to our component to turn off this automatic inheritance, with `inheritAttrs: false`.

📃 **src/components/BaseInput.vue**
```javascript
    <script>
    export default {
      inheritAttrs: false,
      ...
    }
    </script>
```
Then by using `$attrs` we can manually decide which element to forward our attributes to, like so:

📃 **src/components/BaseInput.vue**
```html
    <input
      :id="label"
      :value="value"
      v-bind="$attrs" <!-- specifies this element will inherit attributes -->
      @input="updateValue"
    />
```
Now only our `input` element will inherit our attributes. 

Awesome. Our BaseInput is now entirely dynamic and reusable. And since we named it with “Base_____.vue” that means it will be automatically globally registered for us so we can use it anywhere in our app immediately. If that concept is new for you, you’ll want to learn about it in our [Real World Vue lesson](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/real-world-vue-js/global-components). 

Putting it all together, now our form’s template looks like this:

📃 **src/views/EventCreate.vue**
```html
    <template>
      <div>
        <h1>Create an Event</h1>
        <form @submit.prevent="createEvent">
          <label>Select a category</label>
          <select v-model="event.category">
            <option v-for="cat in categories" :key="cat">{{ cat }}</option>
          </select>
          
          <h3>Name & describe your event</h3>
          <BaseInput
            v-model="event.title"
            label="Title"
            type="text"
            placeholder="Add an event title"
            class="field"
          />
          <BaseInput
            v-model="event.description"
            label="Description"
            type="text"
            placeholder="Add a description"
            class="field"
          />
          <h3>Where is your event?</h3>
          <BaseInput
            v-model="event.location"
            label="Location"
            type="text"
            placeholder="Add a location"
            class="field"
          />
          <h3>When is your event?</h3>
          <div class="field">
            <label>Date</label>
            <datepicker v-model="event.date" placeholder="Select a date"/>
          </div>
          
          <div class="field">
            <label>Select a time</label>
            <select v-model="event.time">
              <option v-for="time in times" :key="time">{{ time }}</option>
            </select>
          </div>
          
          <BaseButton @click="createEvent"/>
        </form>
      </div>
    </template>
```
Notice how our base components have a class of `field`. This is a global style we’re using to add some margin spacing.


----------
## Let’s ReVue

By breaking up our form into reusable base form components, we can make our app more scalable, and the behavior of additional forms that may be added to the app will be more uniform, predictable and debuggable. Componentizing our input is a great step towards that goal.


----------
## What’s next?

As you can see, we are still using raw `select` and `option` elements in this form. In the next lesson we’ll create a reusable **BaseSelect** component for this functionality.
