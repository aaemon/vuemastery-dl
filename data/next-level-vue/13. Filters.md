# Filters

Sometimes the data that we have in our app isn’t in the format that it needs to be displayed in. 
We might be getting data from an API call for example, which contains dates that aren’t human-readable and need to be re-formatted before they are displayed within a component’s template.

In this lesson, we’ll be learning about Vue **filters**, which can be called from a component’s template in order to format values just before they are displayed. 


----------
## Filtering Trolls

To start understanding filters, let’s dive right into a simple example. Let’s say we’re building an app called TrollBot, whose sole purpose is to make obnoxious trolling comments. 

Like any good troll, we want TrollBot to always comment in all caps. But if we take a look at this dummy component, TrollBot hasn’t capitalized ANY characters in its `comment`.

**Example.vue**
```
    <template>
      <p>{{ comment }}</p>
    </template>
    
    <script>
    export default {
      data() {
        return {
          comment: 'no one cares'
        }
      }
    }
    </script>
```
While the `comment` is pretty trolly, we can make it even worse by creating a simple filter that capitalizes every character in the `comment`. 

We’ll do this by adding a `filters` option to our component, then writing the filter itself, which is simply a function that takes in the value that we want to transform and returns the processed version of it.

**Example.vue**
```
    <script>
    export default {
      data() {
        return {
          comment: 'no one cares'
        }
      },
      filters: {
        shout(comment) {
          return comment.toUpperCase()
        }
      }
    }
    </script>
```
Now we have a `shout` filter that can take the `comment` value and upperCase it. To actually use this filter, we’ll add it in the template, like so:

**Example.vue**
```
    <template>
      <p>{{ comment | shout }}</p>
    </template>
```
Notice how we added the filter name `shout` after the pipe `|`. The pipe is used to pass in the output of the expression `comment` as the input to the filter. 

If we check the browser, we indeed see a shouted comment.

It’s worth noting that our filter has not changed the original `comment` data value. It merely transformed how that value is being *displayed* in the template.

So great… Now TrollBot’s `comment` is being shouted. It’s starting to really sound like a troll now. But you know what this comment is missing? Exclamation marks!!!


----------
## Chaining Filters

We can chain Vue components together to perform multiple operations on our values. So if we also wanted TrollBot to *exclaim* its `comment`, we could create an `exclaim` filter:

**Example.vue**
```
    <script>
    export default {
      data() {
        return {
          comment: 'no one cares'
        }
      },
      filters: {
        shout(comment) {
          return comment.toUpperCase()
        },
        exclaim(comment) {
          return comment + '!!!'
        }
      }
    }
    </script>
```
Now we’ll just chain that filter within the template

**Example.vue**
```
    <template>
      <p>{{ comment | shout | exclaim }}</p>
    </template>
```
If we check the browser, we’ll now see the `shout`ed and `exclaim`ed `comment`:


![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578372224109_1.png?alt=media&token=fa2c07fc-7b5c-471e-88d5-1e332c0dd797)


Lovely, things are getting super troll-like now.


----------
## Additional Arguments

So far so good. TrollBot is behaving like an absolute nuisance. But what if TrollBot is replying directly to someone else’s comment? In that case, it’ll need the ability to address that person with a condescending name, such as “bro”, “boss” or “honey”. 

We can achieve that by making our filter more dynamic so that it can accept an additional argument (the name to call that person) in addition to the initial value (in this case, the `comment`).

**Example.vue**
```
    <script>
    export default {
      data() {
        return {
          comment: 'no one cares'
        }
      },
      filters: {
        shout(comment) {
          return comment.toUpperCase()
        },
        exclaim(comment) {
          return comment + '!!!'
        },
        reply(comment, name) {
          return comment + ', ' + name
        }
      }
    }
    </script>
```
Now we can chain-on our `reply` filter, passing in the `name` we want TrollBot to `reply` with.

**Example.vue**
```
    <template>
      <p>{{ comment | shout | exclaim | reply('bro') }}</p>
    </template>
```
Checking the browser, we can see it definitely works:


![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578372231273_2.png?alt=media&token=02d5b6da-17d5-4ee7-a818-fdc21d61c479)


But the way things are being displayed is a bit off. Ideally, everything would be in caps, and the exclamation points would go after “bro”. This is why it’s important to remember that when chaining filters together,  the order those filters are listed in will be the order in which they are run. 

So we can adjust the order of our filter chain to:

**Example.vue**
```
    <template>
      <p>{{ comment | reply('bro') | shout | exclaim }}</p>
    </template>
```
Then we’ll see this in the browser:


![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578372234208_3.png?alt=media&token=c5b04007-4e9d-4da7-9922-98b490fbbe41)


Great. Now TrollBot is commenting like a complete imbecile.


----------
## Filtering in V-bind

Now that TrollBot has taught us how to filter values within expressions in our templates, it’s worth noting that we can also apply filters within directives.

For example, we might want to format an `id` when we’re using `v-bind`, like so:

```
    <div :id="id | formatId">Don't be like TrollBot</div>
```

----------
## A Next-Level Filter 

Let’s now take a look at our example app and see how we can create a useful filter. If we look at our **EventShow** component, we can see that our event is being displayed oddly.


![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578372234209_4.png?alt=media&token=4b9914ac-d722-412f-b093-6826066235dd)


While a robot may be able to read this, this format isn’t very human-readable. Fortunately, we can use a filter to format our date into a more human-friendly way.

Since we probably want access to a date filter throughout our application, versus just locally on one component, we can create this as a global filter. In a Vue-CLI-generated project, we’d add a global filter in our **main.js** file, just above the root Vue instance. But first let’s create a **filters** directory inside of our **src** directory, and create a **date.js** file.

Inside of this file, we’ll write our filter. Like the other filters we looked at, this will be a function that takes in the `value` that we’re going to format, then returns that transformed value.

**src/filters/date.js**
```
    export default value => {
      const date = new Date(value)
      return date.toLocaleString(['en-US'], {
        month: 'short',
        day: '2-digit',
        year: 'numeric'
      })
    }
```
As you can see above, we are exporting this function, which uses the original date `value` to create a `new Date`. This allows JavaScript to parse that value into a date format that we can then work with. 

How are we working with it? We’re running `toLocaleString` on it, which will return the date as a string that is formatted according the configurations that we pass into it. To learn more about the method, check out [the docs here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleString). As you can see, we’re setting `'``en-US``'` as the default locales argument, then an object  that tells the `month`, `day` and `year` how to appear.

Now we’ll head to our **main.js** file and import this filter file, and register it as a global filter.

**main.js**
```
    import DateFilter from './filters/date'
    
    Vue.filter('date', DateFilter)
```
Notice how we imported it as `DateFilter`. We can import it with whatever name we like since we exported it as `default`. Now our `date` filter is ready to be used wherever we need it, such as back in our **EventShow** component.

**src/views/EventShow.vue**
```
    <template>    
    ... 
      <span class="eyebrow">@{{ event.time }} on {{ event.date | date }}</span>
    ...
    </template>
```
And also in our **EventCard** component, which also displays the event’s date.

**src/components/EventCard.vue**
```
    <template>    
    ... 
      <span class="eyebrow">@{{ event.time }} on {{ event.date | date }}</span>
    ...
    </template>
```
Great! Now our dates are showing up in a human-readable format.

## When we use Filters?  

Now that we understand how to use filters, the question is: When should we use them? There is a bit of debate around this subject, so we took the time to speak with Core Vue Team Member Chris Fritz about it, who helped contextualize this topic.

Some argue that filters should be used instead of methods when you’re exclusively using that functionality in your templates and nowhere else. Others argue that you should always use a method instead, or a computed property when appropriate since its value will be cached and its a more performant option. Additionally, the pipe syntax that filters use behaves differently than a *proposed* pipe syntax for a future version of JavaScript. So you may have a future Vue app that uses pipes (`|`) in two different kinds of ways. 

So it’s worthwhile to keep these considerations in mind as you decide when or if you want to implement a filter.

## Let’s ReVue

In this lesson, we learned how filters are one way to transform the values we are displaying in our templates. We saw how to chain filters together while being mindful of their order, and we learned how to create global filters.
