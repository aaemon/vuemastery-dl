# Dynamic Routing & History Mode

Building on what we learned in the previous lesson on Vue Router, in this lesson we’ll cover the creation of dynamic routes and how to use HTML5 History Mode to get rid of that # in our URL.

## ⚠️ Problem: How to create dynamic routes like /users/gregg?

Often when building websites, we want to create routes that contain dynamic information, like a user’s name for instance `/users/insert-name-here`

## ✅ Solution: Dynamic Routes

First up I’m going to create a new route, and import a new component.

**router.js**
```javascript
    ...
    import User from './views/User.vue'
    Vue.use(Router)
    
    export default new Router({
      routes: [
        ...
        {
          path: '/user/:username',
          name: 'user',
          component: User
        }
      ]
    })
```    

Notice with the new route above, the path has `/user/:username`.  `:username` is called a dynamic segment.  This tells Vue that anything after `/user/` is to be treated as a dynamic route.  When we create the simple template, we can access this parameter like so:

**/pages/user.vue**
```html
    <template>
      <div class="user">
        <h1>This is a page for {{ $route.params.username }}</h1>
      </div>
    </template>
```

A $route object represents the state of the current active route.  It contains data about the route including the params.  To learn more about this object check out the [API documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/api/#the-route-object).

Now when we visit /user/gregg, we see:

Also we can link to dynamic routes by placing parameters in our links:
```html
    <router-link :to="{ name: 'user', params: { username: 'gregg' }  }">Gregg</router-link>
```

## Using Props for Routes

Using `$route.params` in your component limits its flexibility.  A more modular way to create your dynamic components is to set `props: true` in your route configuration.

**router.js**
```javascript
    ...
    export default new Router({
      routes: [
        {
          path: "/user/:username",
          name: "user",
          component: User,
          props: true
        }
      ]
    });
```

This will cause the `$route.params` to be sent into your component as a normal prop.  Inside our component, we’ll then need to receive this prop:

**User.vue**

```html
    <template>
      <div class="user">
        <h1>{{ username }}</h1>
      </div>
    </template>
    
    <script>
    export default {
      props: ["username"]
    };
    </script>
```

Everything will now work the same, except that our component can now be reused as a child component elsewhere, passing in username as a prop.

----------
## The Hash

By now you’re probably noticing that there’s a hash in our URL (`http://localhost:8080/#/about-us`), and you may be wondering what that’s about. “Hash mode” is the default mode for Vue Router and it uses the URL hash to simulate a full URL so the page isn’t reloaded every time the URL changes.  


## ⚠️ Problem: I don’t want the hash

Yeah, most websites don’t use this, you don’t want it either.


## ✅ Solution: History mode + server configuration

In order to remove it we need to add some configuration to our **router.js** :

```javascript
    ...
    export default new Router({
      mode: 'history', // <----
      routes: [
       ...
      ]
    })
```

This tells Vue to use the browser `history.pushState` API to change the URL without reloading the page.

Now when we play around locally it shows the URLs exactly as we would want them, and even when we go to URLs like `http://localhost:8080/about-us` the proper page is loaded, which is interesting don’t you think?  

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578379856256_1.jpg?alt=media&token=960e2406-3f61-43fe-95b3-d9ce601a5276)

Normally when you load up `/about-us` on a server it would look for an `about-us.html` file.  On our application no matter what URL is called up, we must load up `index.html` which is where our application is loaded, and then our router will take over and load up the proper page.  

This is already the default functionality on our development server, but if we go to deploy our application we’ll need to ensure our server has the proper configuration to serve up our index.html no matter what route is navigated to.  The Vue Router documentation has a bunch of [example configurations](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html#example-server-configurations) showing how to do this.


  **Side Question:**  You might be wondering, “why isn’t this the default functionality?”
  
  **Side Answer:** the browser `history.pushState` API is only supported in IE10+, while the current version of Vue provides support for IE9+.  #BlameIE
  
## Caveat: Handling 404s

A side effect of this you should be aware of is that when we go to an invalid URL, we are no longer given the proper 404 file not found error.   There are different ways to combat this, one of which is by creating a `/views/FileNotFound.vue` component, which gets loaded if none of the existing paths match.  To do this we would place this catch-all route at the bottom of our `routes.js`:

```javascript
    ...
    const router = new VueRouter({
      mode: 'history',
      routes: [
        ...
        { path: '*', component: NotFoundComponent }
      ]
    })
```

## There’s More

We obviously aren’t going to cover all the different ways you can use routing.  I recommend you consult the [Vue Router documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/) for more details, like nested routes, transition effects, programmatic navigation, passing props to routes, and SEO concerns.

## Our Example Application

Using this knowledge, let’s update our example application so that:


- Our `EventShow.vue` has a dynamic segment, `/event/:id`, using props.
- Let’s move our event show link into the EventList, where it will normally live.
- Our route.js uses history mode.

First let’s update our **router.js:**

```javascript
    ...
    export default new Router({
      mode: 'history',
      routes: [
        {
          path: '/',
          name: 'event-list',
          component: EventList
        },
        {  // Notice this has to come before /event/:id
          path: '/event/create',
          name: 'event-create',
          component: EventCreate
        },
        {
          path: '/event/:id',
          name: 'event-show',
          component: EventShow,
          props: true
        } 
      ]
    })
```

**EventList.vue**

```html
    <template>
      <div>
        <h1>Events Listing</h1>
        <p>
          <router-link :to="{ name: 'event-show', params: { id: '1' } }">First Event</router-link>
        </p>
      </div>
    </template>
```

**EventShow.vue**

```html
    <template>
      <h1>Showing event #{{ id }}</h1>
    </template>
    <script>
   export default {
      props: ['id']
    }
    </script>
```

Also, let’s remove the show navigation link from the **App.vue**

```html
    <template>
      <div id="app">
        <div id="nav">
          <router-link :to="{ name: 'event-list' }">List</router-link> |
          <router-link :to="{ name: 'event-create' }">Create</router-link> 
        </div>
        <router-view/>
      </div>
    </template>
```

And now when we go into our browser we see everything working!

This is all we need for now, and we’re ready to jump into the next lesson.

In the next lesson we’ll be walking through the anatomy of a Single File Vue component, and showing how to nest components inside our .vue files as we build out our example application.
