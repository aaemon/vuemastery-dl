# Global Components

In this tutorial, we’ll be learning about globally registered components.

We’ll learn:

- Why and when you’d want to use global registration
- Automatic Registration
- How to create an icon component and use it globally


----------
## Why Global Registration?

In the previous lesson we learned how to create a single file component, then import and **locally register** it within another component so we could use it in that parent component’s template. However, with local registration, the component is only available for use within the component in which it’s registered. 

But what if we need a component to be accessible throughout our application? For example, we could have an icon component that we need to use throughout our app. While we could certainly import and locally register it within every parent component that needs to use it, that could become time-consuming and add unnecessary code. It would be more efficient to **globally register** this component. In other words, we could make the component available to every component within our application.

Let’s explore ways we can achieve this.


----------
## Basic Global Registration

You might be wondering what type of components warrant global registration. Some examples of these types of components would be what are commonly called “base components,” such as a button, or an icon. Why “base”? Because these are the smallest building blocks of your apps that will never go away. 

Surely you can imagine how you’d use a button or icon component throughout your application, in multiple views, and in different contexts. 

On that note, let’s start creating an icon component for our app, and we’ll see how we can quickly globally register it.

We’ll fully build out this component later in this lesson, but for now here is our icon component, which we’ll name **BaseIcon.vue**. 

```javascript
    <template>
      <div>Icon</div>
    </template>
    
    <script>
    export default {
    }
    </script>
    
    <style scoped>
    </style>
```

Now if we go into our **main.js** file, we can do the following two steps:


1. Import **BaseIcon.vue**
    import BaseIcon from '@/components/BaseIcon'


2. Globally register it
    Vue.component('BaseIcon', BaseIcon)

Note that we need to register our component *above* where we’re creating our root Vue instance (`new Vue(...)`).

And that’s it. Now our **BaseIcon** can be used throughout our entire application. 


----------
## Automatic Global Registration 

You might be wondering, what if I have an entire collection of base components that I’d like to globally register? Wouldn’t it be verbose and not very DRY to register them all manually like: 

```javascript
    Vue.component('BaseIcon', BaseIcon)
    Vue.component('BaseButton', BaseButton)
    Vue.component('BaseInput', BaseInput)
```

And you’re right. This could get quite repetitive.

If you get to the point you have a bunch components that need to be globally registered, there’s a way to do so automatically.

Here’s the solution directly from the [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-registration.html#Automatic-Global-Registration-of-Base-Components):

**Main.js**
```javascript
    import Vue from 'vue'
    import upperFirst from 'lodash/upperFirst'
    import camelCase from 'lodash/camelCase'
    
    const requireComponent = require.context(
      './components',
      false,
      /Base[A-Z]\w+\.(vue|js)$/
    )
    
    requireComponent.keys().forEach(fileName => {
      const componentConfig = requireComponent(fileName)
    
      const componentName = upperFirst(
        camelCase(
          fileName.replace(/^\.\/(.*)\.\w+$/, '$1')
        )
      )
    
      Vue.component(
        componentName,
        componentConfig.default || componentConfig
      )
    }) 
```
If this looks confusing, don’t worry. Let’s break it down.

```javascript
    import Vue from 'vue'
    import upperFirst from 'lodash/upperFirst' 
    import camelCase from 'lodash/camelCase'
```
We’re importing Vue, and below that we’re importing a couple methods from [Lodash](https://lodash.com/), which is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for common programming tasks.


- [upperFirst](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#upperFirst) converts the first character of a string to upper case.
- [camelCase](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#camelCase) converts a string to [camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) (camelCase isWritten likeThis)

We’ll invoke these methods soon. First, let’s add lodash to our project. We can spin up the Vue UI from the command line with `vue ui` and add lodash from there.

----------

**Webpack’s require.context**

```javascript
    const requireComponent = require.context(
      './components', // the relative path of the directory to search
      false, // subdirectories will not be searched
      /Base[A-Z]\w+\.(vue|js)$/ // regular expression that searches for components starting with "Base" and ending in .vue or .js
    )
```
Above, we’re using [require.context](https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/), which is a feature of Webpack. This is a function that allows you to pass in 3 arguments:


1. A directory to search within.
2. A flag indicating whether subdirectories should be searched, too.
3. A regular expression to match files against.

Webpack looks for `require.context()` in the code while building, then requires every matching file to ensure it’s in your compiled bundle, even if it’s never used.

Moving along, what is this doing?

```javascript
    requireComponent.keys().forEach(fileName => {
      const componentConfig = requireComponent(fileName)
```
Here, `keys()` gets us an array of each file so we can iterate through each and then get the object exported using `requireComponent` so we can globally register each, which we’ll do below.

We may have file names like `BaseIcon.vue`(PascalCase) or `base-icon.vue` (kebab-case). If the name is `base-icon.vue`, we need to convert it to PascalCase, which will allow the component to be referenced as both PascalCase (e.g. `<BaseIcon/>`) or kebab-case (e.g. `<base-icon/>`).

```javascript
      const componentName = upperFirst(
        camelCase(
          fileName.replace(/^\.\/(.*)\.\w+$/, '$1') // removes what's before and after the filename itself
        )
      )
```
Above, we’re using our lodash functions to uppercase the first character of our `fileName` as well as camelCase the following word in the `fileName`.

```javascript
      Vue.component(
        componentName,
        componentConfig.default || componentConfig
      )
    }) 
```
Finally, we’re registering each component globally, and telling Vue to look for the component options on `.default`, which will exist if the component was exported with `export default`. Otherwise, Vue will fall back to the module’s root, which is what’s exported when using `module.exports =`  instead of `export default`.

Now that we understand how to manually and automatically globally register components, you can choose how you’d like to register the **BaseIcon** component. Since it’s only one component, it’s certainly simpler to manually register it. But if you’d like to practice automatic registration, you’re welcome to globally register it with this method described above. 


----------
## **Fleshing out BaseIcon.vue**

Since our **BaseIcon** component will be exactly that: an icon, we can use an SVG within it to draw our icons. SVG stands for scalable vector graphic, which is a topic too deep to cover fully in this lesson. (You can learn more about SVG [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial).)

But instead of working with SVG code directly in our component, we’ll use a library to take care of rendering the SVG icon.

First, install the feather-icons package:

`npm install feather-icons --save`

The feather-icons library is basically a collection of symbols with a simple interface to render whichever one you like.

First, import the library:

```html
<script>
  import feather from 'feather-icons'
  export default {
  }
  </script>
```

And then add a computed property called svg:

```html
<script>
  import feather from 'feather-icons'
  export default {
    computed: {
      svg() {
        return feather.icons['activity'].toSvg({ class: "icon" })
      }
    }
  }
  </script>
```

Inside the svg method, we get an icon from the icons dictionary by name, for example, activity for the activity icon. And then, we use the toSvg method to get the SVG of the icon. The class property is a configuration option that we use to add a class attribute to the SVG.

Now we can render the icon using the v-html attribute and the svg computed property:

```html
<template>
  <div class="icon-wrapper" v-html="svg"></div>
  </template>
```

The v-html attribute will replace the content of the div with the SVG code returned from the svg method. The final rendering will look something like this:

```html
<div class="icon-wrapper">
  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-activity icon"><polyline points="22 12 18 12 15 21 9 3 6 12 2 12"></polyline></svg>
</div>
```

To increase the reusability of our component, we should make the name of the icon a prop:

```javascript
export default {
  props: {
    name: String // the name of the symbol we want to use
  },
  computed: {
    svg() {
      return feather.icons['activity'].toSvg({ class: "icon" })
    }
  }
}
```

And then replace "activity" with this.name

```javascript
export default {
  props: {
    name: String
  },
  computed: {
    svg() {
      return feather.icons[this.name].toSvg({ class: "icon" }) // use this.name
    }
  }
}
```

This way, our **BaseIcon** is designed to be able to draw any symbol we want it to from the feather-icons library. When we place our **BaseIcon** component within the template of a parent component, we can feed it a name via props, which BaseIcon will render the symbol that matches the name.

`<BaseIcon name="activity"/>`

Props are essentially a funnel on your component that lets you pass properties into it from the parent component. If you need a refresher on props, check out our lesson on [Components](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js/components) from the Intro to Vue.js course.

On the topic of props, the toSvg method allows other optional configurations such as width and height to control the size of the icon.

To make our component more dynamic, we can add props that allow us to optionally alter its width and height. By default, the icon will be 24px by 24px, unless we feed different values in as props.

```javascript
props: {
    name: String, 
    width: {
      type: [Number, String],
      default: 24
    },
    height: {
      type: [Number, String],
      default: 24
    }
  },
```

Now we can use these props in the svg computed property to render the icon with the width and height options.

```javascript
computed: {
    svg() {
      return feather.icons[this.name].toSvg({ 
        class: "icon",
        width: this.width, // new prop
        height: this.height // new prop
      })
    }
  }
```

If we wanted to alter its size from the default 24px, we could pass them into **BaseIcon** like so:

`<BaseIcon name="activity" width="48" height="48" />`

Finally, let’s give our **BaseIcon** some style. Here’s the complete component with scoped styles.

```html
<template>
<div class="icon-wrapper" v-html="svg"></div>
</template>

<script>
import feather from 'feather-icons'
export default {
  name: 'Icon',
  props: {
    name: String,
    width: {
      type: [Number, String],
      default: 24
    },
    height: {
      type: [Number, String],
      default: 24
    }
  },
  computed: {
    svg() {
      return feather.icons[this.name].toSvg({ 
        class: "icon", 
        width: this.width, 
        height: this.height 
      })
    }
  }
}
</script>

<style scoped>
.icon-wrapper {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: center;
  color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
  font-size: 1rem;
  font-weight: 600;
  margin-right: 6px;
}
.icon {
  stroke: currentColor;
  stroke-width: 2;
  stroke-linecap: round;
  stroke-linejoin: round;
  fill: none;
}
</style>
```

Now let’s use **BaseIcon** to see it in action.

----------
## Adding BaseIcon to EventCard

Our EventCard component could benefit from an icon. Let’s add a **BaseIcon** next to where we display how many users are attending the event. 

Since we’ve already globally registered the component, we don’t need to import or register it within **EventCard**, we can simply use it in the template right away.

```html
      <h4 class="title">{{ event.title }}</h4>
      <BaseIcon name="users" />
      <span>{{ event.attendees.length }} attending</span>
```

Awesome. Now our **EventCard** is successfully displaying an icon, by using our globally registered **BaseIcon** component.
