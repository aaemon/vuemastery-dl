# Single File Vue Components

In this tutorial, we’ll get acquainted with single file .vue components and how to use them together cooperatively throughout a Vue application.

We’ll be:

- Exploring the anatomy of a vue component
- Learning how to nest components inside each other
- Implementing global and scoped styles
- Adding components to our example app


----------
## Building blocks of a Vue app

Vue components are the building blocks of a Vue app. These components are used, and reused, together to structure your application, which you can envision as a treelike structure.

So how do you create a Vue component? Let’s look at a simple example.


----------
## Anatomy of a Single File Component

In a previous lesson, I created the EventCard.vue file in the `/src/components` directory. If you haven’t created this component yet, you can do so now. Since I installed Vue VSCode Snippets, I can type `vbase` and it’ll scaffold a component for me. 

Let’s play with this to explore the anatomy of a single file component.

Vue components combine markup (usually HTML), logic (JavaScript), and style (usually CSS) into one, single file. Hence the name: single-file component. 

```javascript
    <template>
      <div>
      // here is where we lay out the structure of our component
      </div>
    </template>
    
    <script>
      export default {
        // here is where we give our component the ability to behave and perform logic
      }
    </script>
    
    <style scoped>
    // here is where we design the appearance of our component
    </style>
```

Part of what makes Vue so powerful is how it’s flexible and allows you to use alternatives to the traditional HTML, JS and CSS setup. For example, you could use Pug, TypeScript and SCSS instead by adding the appropriate `lang` attributes. 

```javascript
    <template lang="pug">
    </template>
    
    <script lang="ts">
    </script>
    
    <style lang="scss" scoped>
    </style>
```

You’d just need to make sure you have the proper loaders setup and your Webpack is configured to handle these alternatives. Thanks to the helpful Vue CLI 3, this process is pretty simple. 

For example, if we wanted to use SCSS, we’d need to make sure we install sass-loader and its peer dependency node-sass. We can quickly do this from the command line with:

```
    npm install --save-dev sass-loader node-sass
```

We also have the option to install these dependencies from the Vue UI’s **Dependencies** tab instead.

If you want to figure out what dependencies you’d need for other languages, check out the [Vue Loader docs](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/pre-processors.html).


----------
## EventCard.vue

Taking a look at our completed app, we can see that in our `EventList` view, there’s a list of events. As you might imagine, these aren’t all each coded separately. Rather, they are the same EventCard component, which is being reused. 


![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370343634_1.png?alt=media&token=8316cd56-1519-41b6-be50-a6b27ae0af49)


 
Let’s start building this EventCard component. Since we are creating an Events app, this component will be used to display details of an individual event.

First, let’s add some structure to display the title of our event.

```javascript
    <template>
      <div>
        <h4>Park Cleanup</h4>
      </div>
    </template>
```

Now, our component will display the title “Park Cleanup”. If you’re wondering why we have a `div` here, that’s because a component’s template needs to have only one root element. It can’t have sibling elements, and later in this lesson we’ll be adding more elements next to our `h4`  element to this template.

Let’s go down to our `<script>` section, where we can export our component. 

We’ll export it with `export default` which is the ES6 [export statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export) for exporting a JavaScript module that can be imported from another location with the [import statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import), which we’ll get to in a moment.

```javascript
    <script>
    export default {}
    </script>
```

*Note that there’s also the option to export with* `*module.exports*` *and import with* `*require*`*.* 

Next, we want to give our component some data. Instead of hard-coding the event’s title in our template, we can move that title into our data.

```javascript
    <script>
    export default {
      data() {
        return {
          title: 'Park Cleanup'
        }
      }
    }
    </script>
```
Note that we’re using the ES6 shorthand here with `data() {…}`, which is short for:

```javascript
    data: function () {...}
```

*If you’re wondering why data is a function, you can check out our* [*Intro to Vue.js lesson*](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js/components) *on components.*

Now that we have some `title` data, we can access that `title` from our template, inside an expression.

```javascript
    <template>
      <div>
        <h4>{{ title }}</h4>
      </div>
    </template>
```

It will still display “Park Cleanup” like before. If our `title` data changed to ‘Beach Cleanup’, our template would display that new value reactively.

*If you need a refresher on basic Vue data reactivity, watch* [*this lesson*](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js/vue-instance) *from our Intro to Vue.js course.*

Now if we wanted to give our title some style, let’s say a green color, we’d just add that inside our `style` tag.

```javascript
    <style scoped>
    h4 {
      color: green
    }
    </style>
```

Notice how the scaffold that the snippet created for us includes the `scoped` attribute? This is a convenient way to isolate this style to only this component. If we had not `scoped` this style rule, we could end up with other `h4` elements in our app being styled green when we don’t want them to be.

So you might be thinking, okay cool… so far so good, but I’m not seeing this component in the browser. That’s because it needs to be nested within a view-level component. Let’s do that now.


----------
## Nesting Components

Often, components are nested within other components. We call this a parent-child component relationship. This nesting can go deeper than just one level, which means we can have a parent-child-grandchild relationship, and so on, with components inside components inside components, like Russian nesting dolls.

In our previous lesson on Vue Router, we created our routes and the pages, or `view` components they route to, including `EventList.vue`. 

Just like it sounds, this component will be used to display a list of our events. So we’ll nest our `EventCard.vue` component inside here.

If we open up `EventList.vue`, we see it only has the `template`, so let’s add a `script` section and export the component.

```javascript
    <template>
      <div>
        <h1>Events Listing</h1>
        <router-link :to="{ name: 'event-show', params: { id: '1' } }">Show Event #1</router-link>
      </div>
    </template>
    
    <script>
      export default {
      }
    </script>
```
In order to use our EventsCard component inside here, we’ll need to import it. Using the Vue VSCode Snippet `vimport`, we’ll get:

```javascript
    import Name from './components/Name.vue'
```
Which we can change to:

```javascript
    import EventCard from '@/components/EventCard.vue'
```
Now we need to register this component as a child component of `EventList`. We can use the snippet `vimport-c`, which will gives us:

```javascript
      components: {
        New, // change to our component
      }
```
We’ll change that to:

```javascript
      components: {
        EventCard
      }
```
Note that because we’re using ES6, this is equivalent to: 

```javascript
      components: {
        EventCard: Eventcard
      }
```

Now that `EventCard` is properly imported and registered within its parent, `EventList`, we can use it within `EventList`'s template.

```javascript
    <template>
      <div>
        <h1>Events Listing</h1>
        <EventCard/>
        
        <router-link :to="{ name: 'event-show', params: { id: '1' } }">Show Event #1</router-link>
      </div>
    </template>
```
Now, in our browser we can see “Beach Cleanup”, which means EventCard is being displayed correctly.

----------
## Next Tasks

Now that we understand how to create a component and nest it within another component, we can complete a few more tasks within our app.


- Add global app-level styles 
- Flesh out our EventCard component
- Create a NavBar component 


----------
## Adding Global Styles

As we saw in the `EventCard` component, we can scope specific styles to individual components. So you might be wondering, how do I add global styles to my app that I want to affect every component?

There are several different ways to handle this, but for the sake of this course, we’ll be adding global, app-level styles into the `style` section of our `App.vue` component. Please note that it’s recommended to only store your global styles in one place to avoid potential conflicts.

Let’s pretend our designer just sent us all of these style rules, which we’ll paste into our `style` section. These styles will affect our entire app. 

```javascript
    <style>
html {
  -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;

## Fleshing out EventCard.vue

Our `EventCard` needs to be fleshed out more. We need to:

- Add more event data
- Display that data
- Style it
- Add our `router-link`

So let’s do that now. 

First, we’ll add more data. Since all of the data is related to the event itself, we’ll make an  `event` object that includes the `title` along with an `id` , `time`, `date` and an array of `attendees` objects.

```javascript
      data() {
        return {
          event: {
            id: 1,
            title: 'Beach Cleanup',
            date: 'Tue May 15 2018',
            time: '6:00',
            attendees: [
              { id: 'abc123', name: 'Adam Jahr' },
              { id: 'def456', name: 'Gregg Pollack' }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
```
We’ll add to our template to display that new data, using dot notation.

```javascript
    <div class="event-card -shadow">
      <span class="eyebrow">@{{ event.time }} on {{ event.date }}</span>
      <h4 class="title">{{ event.title }}</h4>
      <span>{{ event.attendees.length }} attending</span>
    </div> 
```
The `eyebrow`,  `title` and `-shadow` classes there are from our global styles. While `event-card`  is a style we’ll add below along with some other component-specific styles, which we can paste below. 

```javascript
    <style scoped>
    .event-card {
      padding: 20px;
      margin-bottom: 24px;
      transition: all 0.2s linear;
      cursor: pointer;
    }
    .event-card:hover {
      transform: scale(1.01);
      box-shadow: 0 3px 12px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 1px 15px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);
    }
    .event-card > .title {
      margin: 0;
    }
    
    .event-link {
      color: black;
      text-decoration: none;
      font-weight: 100;
    }
    </style>
```
Our last step is to wrap this component in the `router-link` we created in the previous lesson. It currently lives in `EventList`, so we’ll cut it from there, paste it into `EventCard`, and wrap it around our outer div. Make sure to add the class of `event-link` here.

```javascript
    <template>
      <router-link class="event-link" :to="{ name: 'event-show', params: { id: '1' } }"> 
        <div class="event-card -shadow">
          <span class="eyebrow">@{{ event.time }} on {{ event.date }}</span>
          <h4 class="title">{{ event.title }}</h4>
          <span>{{ event.attendees.length }} attending</span>
        </div>
      </router-link>
    </template>
``` 
Great now our `EventCard` is displaying all of our data in a template styled with our scoped CSS, and it can link to our `EventShow` view.

----------
## Creating a NavBar Component

Currently our navbar is coded directly within our `App.vue` file. To make our app more organized and readable, we can move that code into its own NavBar component.

So let’s copy the `router-links` from `App.vue` and move them into the `template` of our newly created `NavBar.vue`. The `router-view` will stay where it is since we still want to render our view components at the app level.

**NavBar.vue**

```html
    <template>
      <div id="nav" class="nav">
        <router-link to="/" class="brand">Real World Events</router-link> // this is new
        <nav>
          <router-link :to="{ name: 'event-list' }">List</router-link> |
          <router-link :to="{ name: 'event-create' }">Create</router-link>
        </nav>
      </div>
    </template>
``` 
As you can see, we added an additional `router-link` (Real World Events) that routes to the root path (“/”). This allows a user to click this link from anywhere in the app in order to go to the home screen. In an actual app, this could be replaced with a company’s logo.
 
Now, in the `script`, we’ll make sure to export the `NavBar`.

```javascript
    <script>
        export default {
        }
    </script>
```
And let’s add some styles, too.

```javascript
    <style scoped>
    .nav {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-between;
      align-items: center;
      height: 60px;
    }
    .nav > .brand {
      font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
      font-weight: 700;
      font-size: 1.5em;
      color: #39b982;
      text-decoration: none;
    }
    .nav .nav-item {
      box-sizing: border-box;
      margin: 0 5px;
      color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
      text-decoration: none;
    }
    .nav .nav-item.router-link-exact-active {
      color: #39b982;
      border-bottom: solid 2px #39b982;
    }
    </style>
```
Now we just need to import `NavBar` into `App.vue`, and list it as a component.

**App.vue**

```javascript
    <script>
    import NavBar from '@/components/NavBar.vue'
    
    export default {
      components: {
        NavBar
      }
    }
    </script>
```
Then nest it in the template:

```javascript
    <template>
      <div id="app">
        <NavBar />
        <router-view/>
      </div>
    </template>
```
Great! Our NavBar is working just like it was before, but now it’s isolated into its own component.

----------
## Let’s Review

We learned about:

- The anatomy of a single file Vue component
- How to nest components within other components
- How to implement scoped and global styles

----------
## What’s Next

In the next lesson, we’ll learn how to work with globally registered components as we build an svg Icon component that we can use throughout our app.
