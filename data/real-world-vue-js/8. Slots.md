# Slots

<i>This lesson teaches the older version of slots. We are working on updating this lesson to reflect the latest slot syntax. In the meantime, we recommend checking out our <a href="https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/component-design-patterns/slots-fundamentals">Slots: Fundamentals</a> lesson.</i>

In this tutorial we’ll be learning about how slots can make our components even more flexible.

We’ll be covering:

- How to use slots for dynamic template code
- How to set default slot content
- How to use multiple, named slots


----------
## The Case for Slots

As we build a large web application, we’ll inevitably have commonly reused components. 
Things like:

- **Display elements:** icons, boxes
- **Form elements:** inputs, select fields, buttons
- **Window elements:** modals, pop-ups, notifications

We can create these as global “Base” components like we showed in the last lesson. And we can also customize and configure these components by passing props into them

But what if we need the template of a component to be dynamic. Do we pass in HTML as a prop? No. Instead, we do this with slots, which serve as a placeholder for template code that we can *slot* in.

Let’s take a look at a basic example of a component using slots.


----------
## A Button Component with a Slot

A button is a commonly reused component, which could be utilized in several contexts throughout an application. It could be used to *submit* a form, *update* a feed, and *save* a file, for example.

Instead of making a separate component for each use case:

```html
    <button>Submit</button>
```
```html
    <button>Update</button>
```
```html
    <button>Save</button>
```

We can make one **BaseButton** component, which has a slot that serves as a placeholder for the template code that describes the action the button performs.

**BaseButton.vue**

```html
    <template>
    <div>
      <button><slot></slot></button>
    </div>
    </template>
```
Now, when we use this component, we can write:
```html
    <BaseButton>Submit</BaseButton>
```
“Submit” will be what appears where the `slot` was, like so:

```html
    <div><button>Submit</button></div>
```
In another context, we could say:
```html
    <BaseButton>Update</BaseButton>
```
And “Update” will replace the `slot`.

Voila! Our **BaseButton**’s template can now be modified from wherever it’s being used. 

**Sidenote:** This component is super simple for teaching purposes. We’ll code the rest of this component later in the course.


----------
## Default Slot Content

Sometimes, a component may only occasionally need to make use of its slot. In this case, you’d probably want to set some default content for your slot. Like it sounds, default content is the content that will show up on default if nothing else is added.

For example, if our **BaseButton** is used to *submit* most of the time, we can give it the default slot content of “Submit” by putting that within the `slot` itself.

```html
    <template>
    <div>
      <button><slot>Submit</slot></button> // default slot content: "Submit"
    </div>
    </template>
```
Now, wherever we use **BaseButton**, it will display “Submit”.

```html
    <BaseButton/> <-- displays "Submit"
```
Unless we insert different content when we use it:

```html
    <BaseButton>Update</BaseButton> <-- displays "Update"
```

----------
## Access to Parent Properties

There may be circumstances when you need to print out data in a slot. For example:

```html
    <BaseButton>Purchase for ${{ total }}</BaseButton>
```
Even though `total` here is data on **BaseButton**’s parent component, its slot has access to it, along with the other instance properties of its parent. This allows us to not only feed in template code, but also data and other properties, such as computed properties, directly into the slot.

**Side Note:** In some cases you may want the template code you pass into a slot to have access to data from the slot component itself (the child).  This is what [Scoped Slots](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/advanced-components/render-props-scoped-slots) are for, which is a more advanced topic covered in our Advanced Components course.


----------
## Back to Our Example App

Now that we understand how to use slots, let’s add a slot into our example app. 

Currently, in **EventCard** we have a span below our **BaseIcon** that displays how many users are attending the event.

```html
    <BaseIcon name="users"/>
    <span>{{ event.attendees.length }} attending</span> 
```
This works fine, but since our icon is a “users” icon, it would be more convenient if the text that was associated with how many users are attending this event was actually displayed *by* **BaseIcon**.

Let’s add a slot to **BaseIcon.**

**BaseIcon.vue**
```html
    <template>
    <div class="icon-wrapper">
      <svg class='icon'  :width="width" :height="height">
        <use v-bind="{'xlink:href':'/feather-sprite.svg#'+name}"/>
      </svg>
      <slot></slot> // newly added slot
    </div>
    </template>
```
We want the slot to be replaced with the number of attendees of our event, which is the code that currently lives in our `span`:
```javascript
 {{ event.attendees.length }} attending
```
Since **BaseIcon** now has a `slot` that is ready to be replaced, we can go into **EventCard**, remove the span, and add our attendee count in the inner HTML of **BaseIcon**.

```html
    <BaseIcon name="users">{{ attendees.length }} attending</BaseIcon>
```
When **BaseIcon** renders, its slot will be switched out with “2 attending” since our event currently has two attendees, and our slot can access data from the parent it’s nested within.


----------
## Named Slots

Sometimes it’s useful for a component to have multiple slots.  Let’s take a look at a common UI component in modern web apps to explore this concept.

If you’ve used any large social media platform, you’ve seen a component like this. It’s often called a media object or media box. As you can see, it displays a user avatar, a heading, and a paragraph. 

The user avatar can be its own component, and then we can slot in the heading and paragraph. We could start by adding two slots for them, like so:

**MediaBox.vue**
```html
    <template>
      <div>
        <UserAvatar/>
        <slot></slot>
        <slot></slot>
      </div>
    </template>
```
But there’s a problem when we try to use this component:

```html
    <MediaBox>
      <h2>Adam Jahr</h2>
      <p>My words.</p>
    </MediaBox>
```
Vue won’t know which content should be slotted into which slot. We need to be clear and specify what content goes where, and we can do this by naming our slots.

**MediaBox.vue**
```html
    <template>
      <div>
        <slot name="heading"></slot>
        <slot name="paragraph"></slot>
      </div>
    </template>
```
Now, we can use that name in a `slot` attribute on the template code that will be slotted in.
```html
    <MediaBox>
      <h2 slot="heading">Adam Jahr</h2>
      <p slot="paragraph">My words.</p>
    </MediaBox>
```
Great, we’re slotting in our heading and paragraph where we want them to go.

**Default Slot**

It’s worth noting, we could get away with only naming one of our slots:
```html
    <template>
      <div>
        <slot name="heading"></slot>
        <slot></slot>
      </div>
    </template>
```
Vue would still know how to handle this:
```html
    <MediaBox>
      <h2 slot="heading">Adam Jahr</h2>
      <p>My words.</p>
    </MediaBox>
```
The heading would go into the slot with the name of “heading”, and the paragraph would default into the unnamed slot. 

**Slotting a Full Template**

It’s also possible to pass in a full `template` like this:
```html
    <MediaBox>
      <h2>Adam Jahr</h2>
      <template slot="paragraph">
        <p>My words.</p>
      </template>
    </MediaBox>
```
This could be useful if you wanted to slot in multiple elements into the same slot.

```html
    <MediaBox>
      <h2>Adam Jahr</h2>
      <template slot="paragraph">
        <p>My words.</p>
        <BaseIcon name="book">
      </template>
    </MediaBox>
```
Notice above that we’re able to pass components in through a slot, too.

If we were to look at this code in the Elements tab of the console, we’ll find the template element has disappeared. This means using a template allows us to slot in multiple elements into the same slot, without adding an unnecessary wrapper element.

Great. Now we’ve used named slots to create our own super flexible UI component.
