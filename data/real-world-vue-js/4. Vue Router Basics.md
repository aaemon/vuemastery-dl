# Vue Router Basics

In this lesson we‚Äôre going to introduce you to the tools that Vue uses to navigate between pages (or views) in our application.  We‚Äôll cover:


- What is Client-Side Routing?
- How to set up Vue Router?
- Named Routes, a better way to create navigation links
- Redirecting & Aliasing Routes
- Building out our example app

Let‚Äôs jump in.

## Server-Side vs Client-Side Routing

When it comes to websites, typically we connect our page together with links, right?  A link gets clicked, it calls back to the server for the next page, and that page gets loaded.

We call this ‚ÄúServer-side Routing‚Äù since the client is making a request to the server on every URL change.

When it comes to Vue, many choose client-side routing, meaning that the routing happens in the browser itself using JavaScript.  Our webpage is loaded from a single index.html page and we can use client-side routing to dynamically present different views, depending on which link is clicked.  Often the view we need to show has already been loaded into the browser, so we don‚Äôt need to reach out to the server for it.

A **Single Page Application** (SPA) is defined as a web app that loads from a single page and dynamically updates that page as the user interacts with the app.  However, if we‚Äôre using a single page application we need a way to navigate between content (client-side routing).

## ‚ö Ô∏è Problem: How to do Client-Side Routing?

How can we implement client-side routing in a single page Vue application?

## ‚úÖ Solution: Vue Router

Vue has its own official routing solution, called [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/installation.html).  We set up our project with Vue Router already installed using the Vue CLI in [the lesson covering Vue CLI](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/real-world-vue-js/vue-cli).  Let‚Äôs explore our Vue project to see how it‚Äôs using Vue Router:


----------
## package.json

All of our application‚Äôs dependencies are tracked inside our **package.json** file.  If we take a quick look inside here we see that Vue CLI already inserted Vue Router as a dependency for our project:

```javascript
      "dependencies": {
        "vue": "^2.5.16",
        "vue-router": "^3.0.1", // <---- 
        "vuex": "^3.0.1"
      },
```

This is telling our application to use a version of vue-router that is compatible with version 3.0.1 of the Vue-Router.  

When we created the project with the CLI, it ran ‚Äúnpm install‚Äù for us, which went out to NPM, and asked it for the latest version of Vue-Router between version 3.0.1 and less than 4.0.0 (this is what ‚Äú^3.0.1‚Äù means), and it installed this library inside our application‚Äôs node_modules directory.

Next, let‚Äôs see if we can figure out where our router library gets loaded.  If you look at our application Vue CLI generated for us, we find that it has a /src/router.js file. 

## router.js

At the top of this file, you can see we are importing the vue-router library.

```javascript
    import Vue from 'vue' // Include Vue
    import Router from 'vue-router' // Include Vue Router libary
    import Home from './views/Home.vue' // <--- We'll look at these in a moment
    import About from './views/About.vue'
```

And then we tell Vue to use the Router:

```javascript
    Vue.use(Router)
```

And then we are exporting an instance of Router with some routes defined:

```javascript
    export default new Router({
      routes: [
        {
          path: '/',
          name: 'home',
          component: Home
        },
        {
          path: '/about',
          name: 'about',
          component: About
        }
      ]
    })
```

As you can see, `routes` contains an array of objects. Each object is a specific route. 

The `path` indicates the actual route, in terms of the URL, that the user will be taken to. In this first route, there‚Äôs only the `'``/``'`, meaning this is the root,  the homepage of our application, and what people see when they go to our domain at example.com.

The `name` allows us to give this route a name so we can use that name throughout our application to refer to this route.

The `component` allows us to specify which component to render at that route. Note that these are the same components that were imported at the top of the file.  So as it is, the Home component will be rendered whenever the browser‚Äôs URL ends with a `/` with nothing after it.

Taking a look at the second route object, we can see it has a different path:

```javascript
       {
          path: '/about',
          name: 'about',
          component: About
        },
```

When the browser‚Äôs URL ends with `/about`, the `About` component will be rendered.  Note that the Home and About components are getting imported at the top of the file.

```javascript
    import Home from './views/Home.vue'
    import About from './views/About.vue'
```

At this point you might be wondering (I know I was):

‚ö Ô∏è **Question: Are About and Home ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù or ‚Äúviews‚Äù?**   

We are importing these files from the `/views` directory and in our `src/` directory, we have both a `/components` and a `/views` folder.  So, what are they?

‚úÖ **Answer: They are components.**

We place components in both the `/components` and `/views` folders.  The difference is that when using Vue Router, it‚Äôs a best practice to put the components (AKA pages) that get loaded by Vue Router in the `/views` directory. You then keep the modular (reusable) components in your `/components` directory.  


  **Side Note**: If we wanted we could put all our components inside the `/components` directory and just refer to them there.  We could also rename the `/views` directory to `/pages,` and include the files there.  

So we‚Äôve defined the two different views that our app is going to be able to navigate between, but we actually haven‚Äôt yet loaded this router into our Vue instance.  Remember, our entire application gets loaded from our **main.js**, and if we look inside this file:

## main.js

We can see that we‚Äôre importing our **router.js** file, which is bringing in what we exported from **router.js**.

```javascript
    import router from './router'
```

And in **main.js** you‚Äôll notice that we tell our Vue instance to use the router we‚Äôve imported:

```javascript
    new Vue({
      router,
    ...
```

Since we‚Äôre using ES6, this is the same as writing:

```javascript
    new Vue({
      router: router,
    ...
```

So far so good. Now our router is set up. But where is the functionality added to allow the user to navigate to different parts of the app?

## App.vue

Looking within **App.vue**, there‚Äôs a div with the id of ‚Äúnav‚Äù and inside of it there are some router-links, which are global components we have access to.

```html
    <router-link to="/">Home</router-link>
    <router-link to="/about">About</router-link>
```

And below them is:

```html
    <router-view/>
```

So what‚Äôs happening here? `<router-link>` is a component (from the vue-router library) whose job is to link to a specific route. And `<router-view/>` is essentially a placeholder where the contents of our component will be rendered onto the page.

So when a user clicks on the About link, they are taken to `/about`, and as we saw in **router.js**, that means the About component will load into the place where `<router-view/>` is shown.

To make things a little simpler to understand, I‚Äôm going to change the Home.vue file to just have the same sort of content from the About page.  

Home.vue
```html
    <template>
      <div class="home">
        <h1>This is a home page</h1>
      </div>
    </template>
```

Now if we jump into our browser, we can see that we can navigate between these two different routes.  

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370582824_3.gif?alt=media&token=65c4e90a-50d2-4c0f-a0d3-d8b4f9db0568)

If we call up the Vue Devtools we can see our `router-link` components, and as we switch pages we can see the About or Home components getting switched out as needed.  

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370587756_4.gif?alt=media&token=b50d5e33-b52a-404c-8fcb-bae2fb398f2e)

Also, if we look into the network panel of our browser, we can see that indeed our application is loaded once, and no subsequent requests are asked of the server.   All our templates are loaded into our browser, and we are indeed doing client-side routing.


## Using Named Routes

Another way we can create router links is by using named routes.  Remember how in our `router.js` each of our routes has a `name`?  We can use these names. So instead of:

```html
    <router-link to="/">Home</router-link>
    <router-link to="/about">About</router-link>
```

We can write:

```html
    <router-link :to="{ name: 'home' }">Home</router-link> |
    <router-link :to="{ name: 'about' }">About</router-link>
```

These have equivalent functionality, but Vue is using the name to look up the path that we want to use.  

As you might imagine, if we have a huge application with lots of links to all our pages, and we want to change the path of a route, if we‚Äôre using named routes we‚Äôd only have to change that path in one place instead of everywhere in our app.


## ‚ö Ô∏è Problem: Changing Routes

Sometimes in our applications, after we ship them to production we need to change their paths. Like from `/about`  to `/about-us` .  How might we deal with this?

## ‚úÖ Solution #1: Redirect

Obviously the first step is to change our original route:

```javascript
    const router = new VueRouter({
      routes: [
        ...
        {
          path: '/about-us',
          name: 'about',
          component: About
        }
      ]
    })
```

If we‚Äôre using named routes then we don‚Äôt need to change our `router-link`s at all.  Otherwise we would have to.  Then, since there might be links around the internet to our `/about` page, we want to make that redirect from `/about` to `/about-us`, with the following additional route.  

```javascript
    const router = new VueRouter({
      routes: [
        ...
        { 
          path: '/about', 
          redirect: { name: "about" }
        }
      ]
    })
```

Note we‚Äôre using the named route for the redirect.   We could have also used `redirect: "/about-us"` to get the same functionality, but this is hard-coding a URL in one more place we‚Äôd have to change if the path changed.

## ‚úÖ Solution #2: Alias

Instead of redirecting the old path we might just want to alias it, meaning just provide a duplicate path to the same content.  We could update that path and provide an alias to the old path:

```javascript
    const router = new VueRouter({
      routes: [
        ...
        {
          path: '/about-us',
          name: 'about',
          component: About,
          alias: '/about' // <-----
        }
      ]
    })
```

Now the user can go to `/about` or `/about-us` and they‚Äôll get the same content.

# Example App

The application we‚Äôre building during this course looks like this:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370590705_5.gif?alt=media&token=ad63dfc3-0547-4ab5-831b-53e5c5214052)


This app starts with three different pages.


- **EventList.vue -** A home page where we list all events.  This is also the root page.
- **EventShow.vue -** A page that shows the details of a single event, and allows us to say we‚Äôre attending an event
- **EventCreate.vue -**  A page where we can create an event.

I encourage you to follow along on your own computer and build alongside us.  This way you can play around, I know that‚Äôs how I learn best.  You can find the starting and finishing code on each lesson (if you want to start, or you get stuck) over [on github](https://github.com/Code-Pop/real-world-vue).  In the readme you‚Äôll find something that looks like this:

You can download the starting code at each stage here, you can also clone / fork the repo and checkout the tag you want for the particular lesson.

## Adding our View Components

I‚Äôll start by removing the existing components in the app: deleting `/components/HelloWorld.vue`, `/views/About.vue`, and `/views/Home.vue`.  Then we‚Äôll create these three files:

**EventList.vue**

```html
    <template>
      <h1>Events Listing</h1>
    </template>
```

**EventShow.vue**

```html
    <template>
      <h1>Showing event #1</h1>
    </template>
```

**EventCreate.vue**

```html
    <template>
      <h1>Create Event</h1>
    </template>
```

Then I‚Äôm going to update my **router.js** file to use these files.

```javascript
    import Vue from 'vue'
    import Router from 'vue-router'
    import EventList from './views/EventList.vue'
    import EventShow from './views/EventShow.vue'
    import EventCreate from './views/EventCreate.vue'
    
    Vue.use(Router)
    
    export default new Router({
      routes: [
        {
          path: '/',
          name: 'event-list',
          component: EventList
        },
        {
          path: '/event',
          name: 'event-show',
          component: EventShow
        },
        {
          path: '/event/create',
          name: 'event-create',
          component: EventCreate
        }
      ]
    })
```

We‚Äôll then want to create some navigation in our **App.vue**

```html
    <template>
      <div id="app">
        <div id="nav">
          <router-link :to="{ name: 'event-list' }">List</router-link> |
          <router-link :to="{ name: 'event-show' }">Show Event #1</router-link> |
          <router-link :to="{ name: 'event-create' }">Create</router-link>
        </div>
        <router-view/>
      </div>
    </template>
```

And if we look in our browser, we see that everything is working.

In our next lesson we‚Äôll learn more about Routing, diving into dynamic routes and HTML5 History mode, to get rid of that hash you might have noticed in the URL.
