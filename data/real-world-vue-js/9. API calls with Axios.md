# API calls with Axios

It‚Äôs time to load dynamic data from an API into our Vue application!  In this lesson we‚Äôll learn how to use Axios as our API client to load remote data into our Vue app, we‚Äôll learn to use JSON Server as a mock API server, and we‚Äôll learn some best practices on how to keep our service code separate from the rest of our app.  If you‚Äôre just joining us (or you want to refresh your codebase), here is [our starting code](https://github.com/Code-Pop/real-world-vue/releases/tag/lesson9-axios-start).  You can find a link to our finished code over in lesson resources.


## üåã Static to Dynamic Data

As we mentioned in the CLI lesson, when we‚Äôre ready to deploy our application, we‚Äôll run `npm` `run` `build` which will package-up our application with all our components and libraries into the `dist` directory.  This is what we‚Äôd publish on a server, with the proper server configuration for Vue Router (mentioned in lesson 5).

However, we haven‚Äôt yet loaded any dynamic data into our application.  Everything at this point has simply been static.  If we look inside our `EventCard.vue` file we see the following hardcoded data:

```html
    ...
    <script>
    export default {
      data() {
        return {
          event: {
            id: 1,
            title: 'Beach Cleanup',
            date: 'Tues Aug 19, 2018',
            time: '6:00',
            attendees: [
              { id: 'abc123', name: 'Adam Jahr' },
              { id: 'def456', name: 'Gregg Pollack' }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
    </script>
    ...
```

Instead, we want to pull this dynamic event data from a database.

The most common way to load data into our Vue application is by doing an API call from the browser after Vue is loaded.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578369872629_0.jpg?alt=media&token=f2a47f39-3f4b-4b76-9a5b-f40d3432b735)


As you can see in the diagram above, API calls are made as needed when your Vue pages need dynamic data.


----------
## üìó The Library to Make API Calls

While Vue has an official library for routing (Vue Router), it doesn‚Äôt have an official library for making calls to APIs.  There are other JavaScript libraries that do a pretty great job at doing this for you, like [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. 

Axios has a whole set of features, with the ability to:

  - Do GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests
  - Add authentication to each request
  - Set timeouts if requests take too long
  - Configure defaults for every request
  - Intercept requests to create middleware
  - Handle errors and cancel requests properly
  - Properly serialize and deserialize requests & responses

Yeah, it does a lot for you.  Can you see why it‚Äôs better to use an external library rather than Vue creating its own?


----------
## ‚§¥Ô∏è The Basic Get Request

Axios allows you to perform GET requests in your JavaScript like so:

```javascript
    axios.get('https://example.com/events') // Call out to this URL
      .then(response =>
        console.log(response.data);  // When the response returns, log it to the console
      })
      .catch(error => 
        console.log(error);  // If an error is returned log it to the console
      })
```

It‚Äôs worth noting here that this code is **asynchronous**.  This means that when the above code is executed, at no point is it going to wait.  In particular, it‚Äôs not going to pause and wait until a response is received from the `https://example.com/events` endpoint. 

When a response is returned, whenever that happens, **then** it will get logged to the console.  If an error occurs, then it will **catch** the error and log it to the console.

## ü•Ö Goal: Load Events Using an API
![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578369931241_1.jpg?alt=media&token=cffafbe2-9c11-438a-bc61-b2e26d99a7af)


If you‚Äôve been following along building our app, you are familiar with the following screen on the right. As you can see, we are displaying an event.  Our goal for the remainder of this lesson is to load events from an API.  In order to do this we‚Äôll need to:


1. Mock an API server we can call
2. Install Axios
3. Build the API call using Axios
4. Use the event data in our component
5. Reorganizing our Code

If you‚Äôd like to follow along, you‚Äôll want to make sure your example app is up to speed. If you‚Äôre just joining us (or you want to make sure you‚Äôre at the right step) you can download the starting code here.


## 1. Mocking up the API Server

API backends can be built using back-end frameworks like Laravel, Ruby on Rails, Express.js, or Django, to name a few.  They can also be built using services like Firebase, Parse, Back4App, or Hoodie to name a few.  However, it can be useful to employ something simpler when we want to create a rapid prototype.  Something like [JSON server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), which gives us a fake Full REST API in less than 30 seconds.  

Before we install it, I‚Äôm going to write up the JSON data we want it to return ([download this file here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Code-Pop/real-world-vue/master/db.json)). Notice this has an array of events:

**db.json**
```javascript
    {
      "events": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "title": "Beach Cleanup",
          "date": "Aug 28 2018",
          "time": "10:00",
          "location": "Daytona Beach",
          "description": "Let's clean up this beach.",
          "organizer": "Adam Jahr",
          "category": "sustainability",
          "attendees": [
            {
              "id": "abc123",
              "name": "Adam Jahr"
            },
            {
              "id": "def456",
              "name": "Gregg Pollack"
            },
            {
              "id": "ghi789",
              "name": "Beth Swanson"
            },
            {
              "id": "jkl101",
              "name": "Mary Gordon"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "title": "Park Cleanup",
          "date": "Nov 12 2018",
          "time": "12:00",
          "location": "132 N Magnolia Street, Orlando, Florida",
          "description": "We're going to clean up this park.",
          "organizer": "Adam Jahr",
          "category": "nature",
          "attendees": [
            {
              "id": "ghi789",
              "name": "Beth Swanson"
            },
            {
              "id": "jkl101",
              "name": "Mary Gordon"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "id": 3,
          "title": "Pet Adoption Day",
          "date": "Dec 2 2018",
          "time": "12:00",
          "location": "132 N Magnolia Street, Orlando, Florida",
          "description": "Help animals find new homes.",
          "organizer": "Gregg Pollack",
          "category": "animal welfare",
          "attendees": [
            {
              "id": "abc123",
              "name": "Adam Jahr"
            },
            {
              "id": "ghi789",
              "name": "Beth Swanson"
            },
            {
              "id": "jkl101",
              "name": "Mary Gordon"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
```
I‚Äôm going to store this at the root of our application.  Now let‚Äôs get our JSON server installed and up and running.  We can install it and get the command line tool (that‚Äôs the `-g`) by running:

```
    npm install -g json-server
```

Now to spin up this little API server we just run:

```
    json-server --watch db.json
```

When we run this line we should see:

```
      \{^_^}/ hi!
    
      Loading db.json
      Done
    
      Resources
      http://localhost:3000/events
    
      Home
      http://localhost:3000
    
      Type s + enter at any time to create a snapshot of the database
      Watching...
```

If we call up our browser and head over to `http://localhost:3000/events` we should see all of our events listed in json.

## 2. Install Axios

There are two different ways we can install Axios. Since Vue CLI has such a beautiful user interface, I‚Äôm just going to use it.  I‚Äôll fire up the Vue CLI on the command line by running:

`vue ui` 

The first thing I see in my browser is:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578369937564_2.jpg?alt=media&token=ac9dd596-3ec7-41d4-88fd-d7eac576839e)


Notice how it says that the latest version of each of these plugins is 3.0.0?  You might notice (when you‚Äôre going through this tutorial) that newer versions of libraries have been released (or you might not).  You can click on that ‚¨áÔ∏è icon on the right to install the latest versions of these libraries.  I‚Äôll do that now.  

Doing this not only updates my `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files with the new plugin versions, but it installs these new versions into my `/node_modules` directory.  Since I updated Vue CLI, I‚Äôm going to restart the server.

Next, I‚Äôm going to click on the second item in the left-hand navigation which will bring me to packages.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578369948273_3.jpg?alt=media&token=dda0c1af-59f0-411f-9beb-cf15d5d89e9b)


Looks like I have things to update here, too, which I will do now.  Then I‚Äôm going to hit that ‚ÄúInstall dependency‚Äù button on the top right and search for ‚ÄúAxios‚Äù.  I‚Äôm going to select it and hit ‚ÄúInstall Axios‚Äù.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370024620_4.jpg?alt=media&token=0d8867c2-55bd-4168-9cc0-fa72f2ad7a9d)


If you ever want to see what the CLI User Interface is doing under the hood, just take a look back at your terminal window.


## üéôÔ∏è Without the UI - Kickin it Old Style

If I wanted to do everything above right from the command line, instead of from a pretty user interface (I dunno why ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), I could check for outdated libraries by running:

`npm outdated`

Given the original state of my app above, this will show me:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370024621_5.jpg?alt=media&token=67c63cd1-1ac7-4b36-a356-266546e3d9b7)


To update each of them, all I need to run is:

`npm update <package>`

Or I can just update all of them by simply running:

`npm update`

And then I can install Axios by running

`npm install axios`

Now you know how to install new dependencies to your application two different ways!  Whee üòÑ!


## 3. Do the actual API call using Axios

We now have the Axios library available in our Vue app, and we want our event data to be called when the list of events is loaded in our `EventList.vue` file:

```html
    ...
    <script>
    import EventCard from '@/components/EventCard.vue'
    import axios from 'axios' // <--- brings in the axios library
    
    export default {
      components: {
        EventCard
      },
      created() {
        axios
          .get('http://localhost:3000/events')  // Does a get request
          .then(response => {
            console.log(response.data) // For now, logs out the response
          })
          .catch(error => {
            console.log('There was an error:', error.response) // Logs out the error
          })
      }
    }
    </script>
```

Notice how we are importing the axios library, and it looks like we‚Äôre declaring a `created` function.  The created function is inside an object so really we‚Äôre doing this:

```javascript
    created: function() { ... }
```

This line of code is telling Vue, ‚ÄúWhen this component is first instantiated, but before it‚Äôs drawn on the page (rendered), run this code.‚Äù  Created is one of many [life-cycle hooks](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/instance.html#Instance-Lifecycle-Hooks) we can declare inside our Vue applications to run code at different key moments of a component‚Äôs life cycle.

Remember, this code is asynchronous, meaning that it won‚Äôt cause our browser to freeze no matter how long the API takes.  When our API returns data, it will log it out to the console, or if it errors, it will log the error.  

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370092037_6.jpg?alt=media&token=c3d16c1c-05f9-4c6b-b6f9-eb4bfd33dd0e)

## 4. Use the event data in our component

Next, we want to use the data we received from our API. Let‚Äôs create an array in our `EventList.vue`‚Äôs data, which we‚Äôll use to store the retrieved data.

```javascript
      data() {
        return {
          events: []
        }
      },
```

This is a reactive property.  Thus, when data is received from our API, Vue will update the places in our code/templates where `events` is used.  

Our next step in this file is to set the data returned from our API equal to our `events` array.

```javascript
    ...
        axios
          .get('http://localhost:3000/events')  
          .then(response => {
            this.events = response.data // <--- set the events when returned
          })
          .catch(error => {
            console.log('There was an error:', error.response) 
          })
    ...
```

Lastly, we need to change the way we display our EventCard.  We want to create a new `EventCard` component for each event contained within our events array.  We‚Äôll do this by iterating through our `events`, and sending the event object in as a prop to each new EventCard:

```html
    <template>
      <div>
        <h1>Events Listing</h1>
        <EventCard v-for="event in events" :key="event.id" :event="event"/>
      </div>
    </template>
```

Notice above we iterate through each event using a `v-for`, we set a key on each one, and we pass each event to the EventCard as a prop with `:event=``"``event``"`.

The code all together for our `EventList.vue` now looks like this:

```html
    <template>
      <div>
        <h1>Events Listing</h1>
        <EventCard v-for="event in events" :key="event.id" :event="event"/>
      </div>
    </template>
    <script>
    import EventCard from '@/components/EventCard.vue'
    import axios from 'axios'
    
    export default {
      components: {
        EventCard
      },
      data() {
        return {
          events: []
        }
      },
      created() {
        axios
          .get('http://localhost:3000/events') 
          .then(response => {
            this.events = response.data // <--- set the events data
          })
          .catch(error => {
            console.log('There was an error:', error.response)
          })
      }
    }
    </script>
```

One more small step.  We need to jump into our `EventCard.vue` and tell it to accept the `event` prop.  It‚Äôs as simple as removing our seed data in this file and changing our script code to:

```html
    ...
    <script>
    export default {
      props: {
        event: Object
      }
    }
    </script>
    ...
```

We jump into our browser, and poof, it‚Äôs working!

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370095504_7.jpg?alt=media&token=59b287d6-243b-4dd5-be6f-a8e9edfc9f5e)


You might notice that when we click on one of these it always shows the same thing, regardless of which event we clicked:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370099319_8.jpg?alt=media&token=003bb603-ad04-48d7-a529-82dc01830505)


To fix this we simply need to add the event.id to our `router-link` in `EventCard.vue` like so:

```html
    <router-link class="event-link" :to="{ name: 'event-show', params: { id: event.id } }">
```

## 5. Reorganizing Our Code

In the above example, I wanted to show you the most bare-bones example to get things working. However, in our application we‚Äôre going to make additional API calls.  So for better [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) let‚Äôs refactor our code slightly to move our Axios API calls into a service file.  We‚Äôll create a services directory where we‚Äôll create our `EventService.js`.  It‚Äôll look something like this:

/src/services/EventService.js
```javascript
    import axios from 'axios'
    
    const apiClient = axios.create({  
      baseURL: `http://localhost:3000`,
      withCredentials: false, // This is the default
      headers: {
        Accept: 'application/json',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    })
    
    export default {
      getEvents() {
        return apiClient.get('/events')
      }
    }
```

Notice here I‚Äôm instantiating axios with some configuration and storing that in a constant.  This is good because now our app will only ever have one axios instance, even if different pages use it to make API calls.  I‚Äôve also added some configuration. This is where you might need to add authorization keys if the API you want to use has security. You‚Äôll want to consult the [Axios documentation](https://github.com/axios/axios) for the configuration options.

You might also notice how I put the `baseURL` in the configuration, so the get command becomes `get('/events')`, since it just adds that to the base URL.  

Now back inside our `EventList.vue` I'll just change two things.  First I‚Äôll replace the axios import line to import our new service:

```javascript
    import EventService from '@/services/EventService.js'
```

and then inside `created` we‚Äôll use this service:

```javascript
      created() {
        EventService.getEvents() // <-----
          .then(response => {
```

That‚Äôs all there is to it.


----------
## üõë Problem: Implementing the Show Event Page

At the moment when we click on an event we only see:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370102701_9.jpg?alt=media&token=24f8d279-6c99-442c-96d9-02f69bb12d1a)


Let‚Äôs use our new EventService to query for this event data when it‚Äôs clicked on.


## ‚úÖ Solution: Adding another API call

To fetch the proper event when an event is clicked or when it‚Äôs linked to directly via url (`/event/3`), we‚Äôll start by modifying our `EventShow.vue` file.

```html
    <template>
      <h1>Showing event {{ event.title }}</h1>
    </template>
    
    <script>
    import EventService from '@/services/EventService.js'
    export default {
      props: ['id'],
      data() {
        return {
          event: {}
        }
      },
      created() {
        EventService.getEvent(this.id) // <--- Send the prop id to our EventService
          .then(response => {
            this.event = response.data
          })
          .catch(error => {
            console.log('There was an error:', error.response)
          })
      }
    }
    </script>
```

You‚Äôll notice we‚Äôre now printing the event title in our template, then in our script we import the `EventService`, we have a new data item called `event`, and in `created` we send the prop `id` to our `EventService` to make the proper call to our API.  

Now we need to add a function to our `/services/EventService.js`:

```javascript
    export default {
      ...
      getEvent(id) {
        return apiClient.get('/events/' + id)
      }
    }
```

That‚Äôs all we need, and when we look in our browser, we now see:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370106815_10.png?alt=media&token=28162d72-83bf-4f93-be02-82799026de51)


Yay, it‚Äôs pulling from our JSON Server API just the data for this event.


----------
## üé® Making it Pretty

At this point, let‚Äôs add some additional formatting for this page to print out more of the event information.  Now here‚Äôs `EventShow.vue`:

```html
    <template>
      <div>
        <div class="event-header">
          <span class="eyebrow">@{{ event.time }} on {{ event.date }}</span>
          <h1 class="title">{{ event.title }}</h1>
          <h5>Organized by {{ event.organizer }}</h5>
          <h5>Category: {{ event.category }}</h5>
        </div>
        <BaseIcon name="map"><h2>Location</h2></BaseIcon>
        <address>{{ event.location }}</address>
        <h2>Event details</h2>
        <p>{{ event.description }}</p>
        <h2>Attendees

Now my Beach Cleanup event looks like:

## üõë A Random Console Error

You might have noticed that there‚Äôs a random console error occurring on both our event show page, which looks something like:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370110717_12.jpg?alt=media&token=0a5252d7-eee5-4e4c-990f-a7cfc8127e3b)

Not fun!  It looks like it‚Äôs trying to call length on an undefined variable.  What‚Äôs going on here, is when the page initially loads, `event.attendees` has not been populated from our API.  So the page is loading, it‚Äôs hitting an error, but then it receives the data and the page loads normally.  This is why everything seems to be working fine.  However, it‚Äôd be nice to code this in a way that doesn‚Äôt throw browser errors.  


## ‚úÖ Solution: Check if exists

The simplest way to solve this problem is to add a **ternary if** inside our template.  So inside `EventShow.vue` we could write:

```html
    <span class="badge -fill-gradient">{{ event.attendees ? event.attendees.length : 0 }}</span>
```

Now if `event.attendees` does not exist yet we just print out 0. Poof, no more error üòÅ.  

Obviously, there are other ways in Vue to solve this problem. We could not render the event template until our Axios call is returned.  We could also ensure attendees is initialized as an empty array.  We could also add a loading spinner while we‚Äôre waiting for data to return.  If you Google around you‚Äôll find many different ways to implement this.

# ‚è™ Let‚Äôs ReVue

In this lesson we learned a bunch.  We learned how:


- Usually in Vue we load-in dynamic data by making asynchronous API calls.
- The Axios library allows us to make API calls.
- We make calls to our API in our component‚Äôs created lifecycle hook.
- By keeping our Axios code in a service file, we can separate our concerns.
- We need to be careful about trying to log out data in our template that may not exist on initial load.

In the next lesson we will dive into Vuex, the official state management library for Vue.
