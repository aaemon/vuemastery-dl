# Scoped Slots & Render Props

As you make your components more reusable across your application there are two patterns that can help you make your components more flexible, maintainable, and less brittle: Scoped Slots and Render Props.  In this lesson weâ€™ll be going over the use-case, and understanding both techniques.

## Our Starting Code
```html
    <div id="app">
      <products-list :products="products"></products-list>
    </div>
    
    <script src="vue.js"></script>
    <script>
      Vue.component('products-list', {
        props: {
          products: {
            type: Array,
            required: true
          }
        },
        template: `
        <ul>
          <li v-for="product in products">
            {{ product.name }}
          </li>
        </ul>
      `
      })
      new Vue({
        el: '#app',
        data: {
          products: [{
            name: 'Magnifying Glass',
            image: 'magnify.png'
          }, {
            name: 'Light Bulb',
            image: 'bulb.png'
          }]
        }
      })
    </script>
```

As you might expect, this will display each product name:

## Problem: Extending the Component

What happens when we want a `products-list` component that has the option to also show the image?  We might extend the code like so:

```html
    <div id="app">
      <products-list :products="products"></products-list>
      <products-list :products="products" :show-image="true"></products-list>
    </div>
    
    <script src="vue.js"></script>
    <script>
      Vue.component('products-list', {
        props: {
          products: {
            type: Array,
            required: true
          },
          showImage: {
            type: Boolean,
            default: false
          }
        },
        template: `
        <ul>
          <li v-for="product in products">
            <img v-show="showImage" :src="product.image" />
            {{ product.name }}
          </li>
        </ul>
      `
      })
      new Vue({ // ... Same as above ...})
    </script>
```

Notice how weâ€™re using a new prop called `showImage`, which if true shows the product image. This would display:

## The Problem with this Implementation

What happens when sometimes we need our `products-list` component to also sometimes display price, sale price, add to cart buttons, different styles, or different bullets?  What might result is a very brittle component full of v-ifs and v-shows.  There has to be a better way!


## The First Solution: Scoped Slots

Scoped slots provide us with an alternative way to solve this problem.  Speaking of the problem letâ€™s make it a little more difficult.  How might we start with the original code above, and this time show the products image AND uppercase the productâ€™s name?

Hereâ€™s how we could solve it using scoped slots:

```html
    <div id="app">
      <products-list :products="products"></products-list>
      <products-list :products="products">
        <template slot="product" slot-scope="slotProps">
          <img :src="slotProps.product.image" /> {{ slotProps.product.name.toUpperCase() }}
        </template>
      </products-list>
    </div>
    <script src="vue.js"></script>
    <script>
      Vue.component('products-list', {
        props: {
          products: {
            type: Array,
            required: true
          }
        },
        template: `
        <ul>
          <li v-for="product in products">
            <slot name="product" :product="product" >
                {{ product.name }}
            </slot>
          </li>
        </ul>`
      })
      new Vue({ ... Same as above ... })
    </script>
```

First notice `<slot name="product" :product="product" >`, this is being created like a normal slot, but it also has `product` as a `slotProp`.  This `slotProp` can get accessed by the parent if the parent wants to override what gets displayed by default in the slot, which in this case is `{{ product.name }}`.  

The parent can write out markup to get displayed inside the slot by writing `<template slot="product" slot-scope="slotProps">`.  Inside the slotProps parameter the value is first `{ "product": { "name": "Magnifying Glass", "image": "magnify.png" } }`  and then it is `{ "product": { "name": "Light Bulb", "image": "bulb.png" } }`, the two values inside the products array.  As you might expect, this displays:


![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578371540153_2.jpg?alt=media&token=b4af06a0-b99c-43c6-bf72-f16d33c6a522)

## Destructuring

Itâ€™s worth noting at this point that we can use destructuring to make using slotProps a little more readable.  So instead of writing:

```html
    <template slot="product" slot-scope="slotProps">
      <img :src="slotProps.product.image" /> {{ slotProps.product.name.toUpperCase() }}
    </template>
```

We can simplify this to:

```html
    <template slot="product" slot-scope="{{ product }}">
      <img :src="product.image" /> {{ product.name.toUpperCase() }}
    </template>
```

and we get the same result.


## Using Scoped Slots in the Wild

Scoped Slots can often be found in reusable component libraries like Damian Dulishâ€™s [Vue-multiselect library](https://vue-multiselect.js.org/#sub-custom-option-template).  In the dropdown below we can customize the way the options are displayed by using slot-scope in our parent:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578371546649_3.jpg?alt=media&token=53c61fd7-6e83-442b-add4-5f225bc58e4c)


As you can see, this sort of pattern can be used for all sorts of reusable functionality.

## The Second Solution: Render Props

In order to use render props to solve this problem, we will need to convert our template in our example code into a render function, like so:

```html
    <div id="app">
      <products-list :products="products"></products-list>
    </div>
    <script src="vue.js"></script>
    <script>
      Vue.component('products-list', {
        props: {
          products: {
            type: Array,
            required: true
          }
        },
        render(h) {  // <-- Notice our render function
          return h('ul', [
            this.products.map(product =>
              h('li', [product.name])
            )
          ])
        }
      })
      new Vue({ ... Same as above ... })
    </script>
```

If youâ€™re not familiar with render functions yet, I highly recommend you go [watch lesson 4](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/advanced-components/template-compilation/) of this course where we explain template compilation.  

To use **Render props** as a technique to solve our problem, we will be literally sending in a render function as a prop into our component.  See below:

```html
    <div id="app">
      <products-list :products="products"></products-list>
      <products-list :products="products" :product-renderer="imageRenderer"></products-list>
    </div>
    <script src="vue.js"></script>
    <script>
      Vue.component('products-list', {
        props: {
          products: {
            type: Array,
            required: true
          },
          productRenderer: {  // <-- Here's our new prop
            type: Function,
            default (h, product) { // <-- By default just print the name
              return product.name
            }
          }
        },
        render(h) {
          return h('ul', [
            this.products.map(product =>
              h('li', [this.productRenderer(h, product)]) // use our new prop
            )
          ])
        }
      })
      new Vue({
        el: '#app',
        data: {
          products: [{
            name: 'Magnifying Glass',
            image: 'magnify.png'
          }, {
            name: 'Light Bulb',
            image: 'bulb.png'
          }],
          imageRenderer(h, product) { // <-- The imageRenderer I'm passing in
            return [
              h('img', {
                attrs: {
                  src: product.image
                }
              }),
              ' ',
              product.name.toUpperCase()
            ]
          }
        }
      })
    </script>
```

Notice my comments above, and then notice how I call the component: `<products-list :products="products" :product-renderer="imageRenderer"></products-list>`.  Here Iâ€™m passing in the `imageRenderer` that I declare in the root element.

If I wanted to clean this up a little I could use the JSX babel plugin, which would allow me to write JSX inside of my render functions.  Itâ€™ll feel much more React like, if thatâ€™s something you enjoy. ðŸ˜‰


## Using Render Props in the Wild

Just like with Scoped Slots we can find component libraries that use this pattern, like the [Vue-Auosuggest](https://github.com/Educents/vue-autosuggest) library from Darren Jennings.  There are times when we might want to customize the drop-down list of autosuggestions, like you see below, with the picture next to the suggestion.

If we look inside the readme, we find that we can pass in a `renderSuggestion` method to this component library to specify the way your suggestions are displayed.  It even shows you the JSX syntax:

## Letâ€™s ReVue

If youâ€™ve never seen either of these patterns before, you might be wondering why you wouldnâ€™t always use Scoped Slots.  In my opinion (and Evan Youâ€™s) Scoped Slots is definitely the more Vue friendly solution.  However, Iâ€™m sure there are some cases where you may need the extra power of Render Props, or if youâ€™re using JSX with render functions.  

Both Scoped Slots and Render Props allow the parent component to control how the childâ€™s data is displayed, which can help you create reusable and maintainable components.
