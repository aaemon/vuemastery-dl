# Opening an Email

For the starting code for this lesson, switch to branch: [https://github.com/Code-Pop/build-gmail-clone-with-vue-3/tree/video-5-start](https://github.com/Code-Pop/build-gmail-clone-with-vue-3/tree/video-5-start)

What we're going to be doing in this lesson is make it so clicking on an email *opens* the email, instead of just marking it as read.  It'll open below the email table, and then in the next lesson we'll make it open in a modal.

Let's start by renaming the `readEmail` method to `openEmail`.

Then, in the `openEmail` method, we'll set the `openedEmail` variable as the selected email.

```javascript
openEmail(email){
  email.read = true
  axios.put(`http://localhost:3000/emails/${email.id}`, email)
  this.openedEmail = email;
},
```

To make that work, we'll need to return the `openedEmail` variable as part of our setup.  It will default to null.

```javascript
async setup(){
  let {data: emails} = await axios.get('http://localhost:3000/emails');
  return {
    format,
    emails,
    openedEmail: null
  }
},
```

Then, before investing heavily in styling, we'll show that what we've got set up works.

```html
<div v-if="openedEmail">{{openedEmail.subject}}</div>
```

Once we've confirmed that by clicking around a bit, it's time to create the MailView component.

We'll start by treating it as if it already exists and using it in the MailTable component.

```html
<MailView v-if="openedEmail" :email="openedEmail" />
```

```javascript
import { format } from 'date-fns';
import axios from 'axios';
import MailView from '@/components/MailView.vue';

export default {
  //...
  components: {
    MailView
  },
  //...
}
```

Then we'll create a basic version of that component.

```html
<template>
  <div class="email-display">
    <h2 class="mb-0">Subject: <strong>{{email.subject}}</strong></h2>
    <div><em>From {{email.from}} on {{email.sentAt}}</em></div>
    <div>{{email.body}}</div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    props: {
      email: {
        type: Object,
        required: true
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

Notice that the way we use `props` stays the same.  The only difference is that you can access your props in the setup function, as the first argument.  Note that we will not be using the props in the setup function in this video.

```javascript
export default {
  // for demonstration purposes only
  setup(props) {
    let email = props.email
    //...
  },
  props: { ... }
}
```

Now we should be able to see it displaying.

We're now seeing the entire email below the table, but there are some data display issues.  Let's fix those.

First, we'll fix the sentAt display using the `format` method from date-fns.  We could use the `data` and `setup` functions for this, and they're of equivalent complexity, so let's use the more flexible `setup` function.

```javascript
import { format } from 'date-fns'

export default {
  setup(){
    return {
      format,
    }
  },
  props: { ... }
}
```

```html
<div><em>From {{email.from}} on {{format(new Date(email.sentAt), 'MMM do yyyy')}}</em></div>
```

With that improved, now let's do something similar for the multi-paragraph email body.  We'll use the `marked` library, which is already in the package.json for the starter code.  It will turn markdown into html that can be fed into the v-html directive.

```javascript
import { format } from 'date-fns';
import marked from 'marked';

export default {
  setup(){
    return {
      format,
      marked
    }
  },
  props: { ... }
}
```

```html
<div v-html="marked(email.body)" />
```

Our email is showing up nicely now.

In the next video, we're going to put this email display in a modal.
