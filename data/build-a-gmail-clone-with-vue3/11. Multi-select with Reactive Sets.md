# Multi-select with Reactive Sets

For the starting code for this lesson, switch to branch: [https://github.com/Code-Pop/build-gmail-clone-with-vue-3/tree/video-11-start](https://github.com/Code-Pop/build-gmail-clone-with-vue-3/tree/video-11-start)

We've had these checkboxes sitting to the left of each email for a while, but we haven't done anything with them.  In the next four lessons, we're going to connect them to app-wide state, add a select-all checkbox at the top, then add a Bulk Action Bar and apply those actions to the checked boxes.

For this lesson, we're going to use a Set and a Reactive object to track which checkboxes are checked.

We'll want an `emailSelection` object which can toggle an email as selected, and has a list of selected emails.  We might use it something like this - note that we have the `@click` event and the `:checked` binding both connected to the `emailSelection` object.

```html
<table class="email-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr v-for...>
      <td>
        <input type="checkbox"
               :checked="emailSelection.emails.has(email)"
               @click="emailSelection.toggle(email)" />
      </td>
      ...
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

A naive implementation of this would use an Array, and then implement some extra code for `has`.  Here's some pseudocode for what we'll be putting in the setup function.

```javascript
let emailSelection = {
  selected: [],
  toggle(email) {
    if(emailSelected) {
      removeSelection()
    } else {
      addSelection()
    }
  }
}
```

`emailSeIected` and `removeSelection()` would each take multiple lines, or at least one longer line, to implement if we used in Array... but if we use a Set, then they both come built-in. 

```javascript
let selected = new Set()
let emailSelection = {
  selected,
  toggle(email){
    if(selected.has(email)) {
      selected.delete(email)
    } else {
      selected.add(email)
    }
  }
}

```

`has` , `delete`, and `add` do exactly what you'd expect.

Now let's test this.  We'll add a console.log in our toggle function, and then display the size of the set in the template.

```javascript
{{emailSelection.emails.size}} emails selected
<table class="mail-table">
  <!-- ... -->
</table>
```

However, we have a problem.  The console.log shows the correct number of checkboxes selected, but template still says there are 0 selected.

That's because the `selected` set referenced by the template is not changing when the email is toggled.  Let's fix this by making it reactive, using the new Vue 3 Reactivity API.

```javascript
import { reactive } from 'vue';
//...
setup() {
  //...
  let selected = reactive(new Set())
  let emailSelection = {
    selected,
    toggle(email){
      if(selected.has(email)) {
        selected.delete(email)
      } else {
        selected.add(email)
      }
    }
  }

  return {
    emailSelection,
    ...
  }
}
```

If you want to know more about `reactive`, I recommend [the VueMastery series on Vue 3 Essentials]([https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/vue-3-essentials/setup-and-reactive-references](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/vue-3-essentials/setup-and-reactive-references)), especially video 2 and 5.

And now our selection is working!  In the next lesson we'll go over how to share this data over multiple components in different parts of your app.
