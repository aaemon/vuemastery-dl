# Email Modal

Opening the email below the mail table is a good proof of concept, but it's not ideal - especially as the number of emails grows.  Much better is to open it up in a modal.

We'll create a generic Modal component

```html
<!-- ModalView.vue template -->
<div class="modal">
  <div class="overlay"></div>
  <div class="modal-card">
    <slot />
  </div>
</div>
```

Then we'll wrap it around the MailView component.  Be sure to import and register the component.

```html
<ModalView v-if="openedEmail">
  <MailView :email="openedEmail" />
</ModalView>
```

This will open up the modal whenever we click on an email.

Next we want to be able to close our modal.

This is accomplished by emitting an event whenever we click on the overlay.

```html
<template>
  <div class="modal">
    <div class="overlay" @click="emit('closeModal')"></div>
    <div class="modal-card">
      <slot />
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    setup(props, {emit}) {
      return { 
	emit
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

```html
<ModalView v-if="openedEmail" @closeModal="openedEmail = null">
  <MailView :email="openedEmail" />
</ModalView>
```

The emitted event will trigger the code in our ModalView declaration, and the openedEmail will be set to null.
