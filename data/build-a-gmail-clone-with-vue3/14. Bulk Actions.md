# Bulk Actions

For the starting code for this lesson, switch to branch: [https://github.com/Code-Pop/build-gmail-clone-with-vue-3/tree/video-14-start](https://github.com/Code-Pop/build-gmail-clone-with-vue-3/tree/video-14-start)

In this lesson we're going to add a set of buttons in the Bulk Action Bar that, when clicked, will perform an action on all selected emails.

First, let's get fix some styling.  We'll remove the `h1` from `App.vue`, then we'll style what we have in our `BulkActionBar.vue` component.  

```html
<div class="bulk-action-bar">
  <span class="checkbox">
    <input type="checkbox"
          :checked="allEmailsSelected"
          :class="[someEmailsSelected ? 'partial-check' : '']"
          @click="bulkSelect" />
  </span>
  <span class="buttons">
    <button>Click Me</button>
  </span>
</div>
```

If you're following along with the starter code, the CSS should already be in your app.  If you're following from scratch, here it is:

```css
button {
  font-size: 16px;
  padding: 8px;
  border-radius: 3px;
  margin: 5px 10px 5px 0px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

button:disabled {
  cursor: auto;
}

button.selected {
  cursor: auto;
  color: black;
  border-color: black;
  border-width: 2px;
}

.bulk-action-bar {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 1000px;
  margin: auto;
  text-align: left;
  padding-bottom: 8px;
}

.bulk-action-bar input {
  margin: 5px;
}

.bulk-action-bar .checkbox {
  margin-right: 6px;
  margin-left: 3px;
}
```

Now that it looks much better, let's create those buttons:

```html
<div class="bulk-action-bar">
    <span class="checkbox">
      <input type="checkbox" 
             :checked="allAreSelected"
             :class="[partialSelection ? 'partial-check' : '']"
             @click="bulkSelect">
    </span>
    
    <span class="buttons">
      <button @click="emailSelection.markRead()">
        Mark Read
      </button>
      <button @click="emailSelection.markUnread()"">
        Mark Unread
      </button>
      <button @click="emailSelection.archive()">
        Archive
      </button>
    </span>
  </div>
```

We've added three buttons, each of which have a different function called on the emailSelection reactive object.  We'll add the `markRead` function to `emailSelection` first.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';
//...
const markRead = () => {
  emails.forEach(email => {
    email.read = true
    axios.put(`http://localhost:3000/emails/${email.id}`, email)
  })
};
```

In order to make this work, we'll need to have our `emails` array in `MailTable.vue` reactive, so be sure to fix that.

Then we'll have our `markUnread` and `archive` functions.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';
//...
const markUnread = () => {
  emails.forEach(email => {
    email.read = false
    axios.put(`http://localhost:3000/emails/${email.id}`, email)
  })
};
const archive = () => {
  emails.forEach(email => {
    email.archived = true
    axios.put(`http://localhost:3000/emails/${email.id}`, email)
  })
};
```

You'll notice how similar they are to `markRead`... we can abstract a lot of that shared code.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

//...
const forSelected = (fn) => {
  emails.forEach(email => {
    fn(email)
    axios.put(`http://localhost:3000/emails/${email.id}`, email)
  })
};
const markRead = () => forSelected(e => e.read = true )
const markUnread = () => forSelected(e => e.read = false )
const archive = () => { forSelected(e => e.archived = true); clear()}

return {
  emails,
  toggle,
  addMultiple,
  clear,
  markRead,
  markUnread,
  archive
}
```

Notice that we have a forSelected function — one that is only used in the composition function, and not returned — that handles looping through the emails, calling the given function for each, then saving it.  Then in the other three new functions, they call forSelected with the function to be called on each selected email.

We also added a call to `clear` to `archive` , since they'll no longer be on that screen.

In production, it may be worthwhile to make the save functionality happen outside the loop in order to improve performance and reduce number of API calls.

Now let's make it so that the buttons are disabled when clicking them won't do anything.  All are disabled when no emails are selected, and mark read/mark unread are disabled when all selected emails are read/unread.

Because emails are a set, we must turn them into an Array before using `every`.  We can use `Array.from(emailSelection.emails)` or the shorter `[...emailSelection.emails]`.

```html
<span class="buttons">
  <button @click="emailSelection.markRead()"
          :disabled="[...emailSelection.emails].every(e => e.read)">
    Mark Read
  </button>
  <button @click="emailSelection.markUnread()" 
          :disabled="[...emailSelection.emails].every(e => !e.read)">
    Mark Unread
  </button>
  <button @click="emailSelection.archive()" 
          :disabled="numberSelected == 0">
    Archive
  </button>
</span>
```

Now we have a really nice screen with lots of great interaction options!
