# useKeydown Composable

For the starting code for this lesson, switch to branch: [https://github.com/Code-Pop/build-gmail-clone-with-vue-3/tree/video-8-start](https://github.com/Code-Pop/build-gmail-clone-with-vue-3/tree/video-8-start)

In this lesson, we're going to abstract our onKeydown functionality to a function that can be reused in multiple components - and in doing so, we're going to see a great use case of the Composition API.

We're going to take this:

```javascript
setup(props, {emit}) {
  let onKeydown = (event) => {
    if(event.key == 'Escape') {
      emit('closeModal')
    }
  }
  
  window.addEventListener('keydown', onKeydown)
  
  onBeforeUnmount(() => {
    window.removeEventListener('keydown', onKeydown)
  })
}
```

And replace it with this:

```javascript
setup({closeModal}) {
  useKeydown({key: 'Escape', fn: () => { emit('closeModal')}})
}
```

So let's start by copy-pasting it into another file with minimal modifications.  We'll call this file `/compositions/useKeydown.js`.

```javascript
import { onBeforeUnmount } from 'vue';

export const useKeydown = function(fn) {
  let onkey = function(event) {
    if(event.key == 'Escape') {
      fn()
    }
  }

  window.addEventListener('keydown', onkey);

  onBeforeUnmount(()=> {
    window.removeEventListener('keydown', onkey);
  })
}

export default useKeydown;
```

This file exports the useKeydown function, which takes one argument (`fn`) and calls that function when the Escape key is hit.  We can call it like this:

```javascript
import { useKeydown } from '../composition/useKeydown'

export default {
  setup(props, {emit}){
    useKeydown(() => {emit('closeModal')})
  }
}
```

Of course, this is a very limited abstraction, but it's useful to show how we can move the function to its own file.  Let's make it a little bit more useful by letting the caller configure which key will trigger the function.

```javascript
export const useKeydown = function(keyCombo) {
  let onKey = function(event) {
    if(event.key == keyCombo.key) {
      keyCombo.fn()
    }
  }
  //... rest of file is the same
}
```

```javascript
setup(props, {emit) {
  useKeydown({key: 'Escape', fn: () => {emit('closeModal')})
}
```

This is great!  It's the functionality that we described at the start.

But we can go a bit further and tackle another use case - what if the user wants to configure multiple keys with one call to useKeydown?  This is a reasonable use case, and in fact will be used very soon in this course, so let's tackle it now.

The answer is to match a keyCombo's key with the pressed key, and then run the given function.

```javascript
export const useKeydown = function(keyCombos) {
  let onkey = function(event) {
    let kc = keyCombos.find(kc => kc.key == event.key )
    if(kc) {
      kc.fn()
    }
  }
  //... rest of file is the same
}
```

```javascript
setup(props, {emit}) {
  useKeydown([
    {key: 'Escape', fn: () => {emit('closeModal')}},
    {key: 'Enter', fn: () => { console.log('logging for demonstration purposes') }
  ])
}
```
