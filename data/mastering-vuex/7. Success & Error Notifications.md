# Success & Error Notifications

Within our application, we have some places in our Vuex code where we might be catching an error, like if our API call failed. Currently, weâ€™re just logging those errors to the console. But that isnâ€™t very helpful for our users, who should be informed when an error happens.

In this lesson, weâ€™ll be learning how to add notifications to our Vuex store when things like errors and successful actions occur, and then weâ€™ll explore how to display those notifications within our UI.


----------
## Problem: Need to Log and Display Notifications

These errors or successes may be happening in many different places in our app, in different components, and from different Vuex Actions. 

We need a way to log them so we can share that state across our application.


## Solution: A Vuex Module

Vuex is our best solution when we need shared state. In our last lesson, we learned about encapsulating Vuex code into modules. Now we need a new **notification** module that stores the State for our appâ€™s success and error notifications. Weâ€™ll then display those notifications to our user.

So letâ€™s create our **notification** module and make sure itâ€™s namespaced.

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/store/modules/notification.js**
```javascript
    export const namespaced = true
    
    export const state = {
      notifications: []
    }
```
As you can see, the `notifications` State is an array. Weâ€™ll want to be able to add a notification into it, and we also want the ability to remove a notification from it. So weâ€™ll add Mutations that handle those State changes.

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/store/modules/notification.js**
```javascript
    let nextId = 1
    
    export const mutations = {
      PUSH(state, notification) {
        state.notifications.push({
          ...notification,
          id: nextId++
        })
      },
      DELETE(state, notificationToRemove) {
        state.notifications = state.notifications.filter(
          notification => notification.id !== notificationToRemove.id
        )
      }
    }
```
Unsurprisingly, the `PUSH` Mutation pushes a new notification that it receives as a payload into the `notifications` State array. As it does so, it adds an `id` property to the notification, using the `nextId` variable thatâ€™s at the top of this file. This will make sure each new notification has a unique id, which weâ€™ll be using later.

The `DELETE` Mutation receives a `notificationToRemove` payload, which is used to filter the `notifications` and remove that specific notification from the State.

Finally, weâ€™ll want some dedicated Actions that can *commit* these Mutations.

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/store/modules/notification.js**
```javascript
    ...
    export const actions = {
      add({ commit }, notification) {
        commit('PUSH', notification)
      },
      remove({ commit }, notificationToRemove) {
        commit('DELETE', notificationToRemove)
      }
    }
```
The last step is to add this module to our **store.js** file.

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/store/store.js**
```javascript
    import * as notification from '@/store/modules/notification.js' // <-- import it
    
    export default new Vuex.Store({
      modules: {
        user,
        event,
        notification // <-- add it here
      },
```
Great. Now our **notification** module is ready to be used!


----------
## Adding Error Notifications

Currently, in the **event** module we created in the previous lesson, we have the `fetchEvents` Action, which makes an API call to get the events from our mock server. 

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/store/modules/event.js**
```javascript
    fetchEvents({ commit, dispatch }, { perPage, page }) {
      EventService.getEvents(perPage, page)
        .then(response => {
          commit('SET_EVENTS_TOTAL', parseInt(response.headers['x-total-count']))
          commit('SET_EVENTS', response.data)
        })
        .catch(error => {
          console.log('There was an error:', error.response) // <--- here
        })
    },
```
As you can see, if we `catch` an error, weâ€™re just logging it to the console. Instead, we want to *dispatch* the `add` Action that lives in our **notification** module, so we can add this error to our `notifications` State.

That would look like this:

```javascript
     ...
        .catch(error => {
          const notification = {
            type: 'error',
            message: 'There was a problem fetching events: ' + error.message
          }
          dispatch('notification/add', notification, { root: true })
        })
```
Notice above, weâ€™re creating a `notification` object, which has a `type` of `'``error``'` and a `message` that describes that error. 

Then weâ€™re passing that `notification` in as the payload where we are dispatching the Action. Since our notification module is namespaced, we can *dispatch* the `add` Action with `'notification/add'`. 

The third argument here, `{ root: true }`, is important. This tells `dispatch` to look for a `notification/add` action at the root of our store, instead of just looking for it inside the module weâ€™re currently in.


----------
## Testing it Out

Since our **EventList** page is what dispatches the `fetchEvents` Action, we can go to that page in our browser while the json-server is not running to test this out. With no mock server running, the API call will fail, and a notification error should be added to our Vuex State.

If we check the Vuex tab of the Vue DevTools we can see an error is definitely added to our `notifications` State. Great!

----------
## More Error Notifications

There are a few more places in our Vuex code where errors can happen, so weâ€™ll want to be dispatching our `add` Action within those, too.

Looking at our **event** module again, we also have the `fetchEvent` Action, which is just logging out errors to the console. 

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/store/modules/event.js**
```javascript
    fetchEvent({ commit, getters, dispatch }, id) {
        var event = getters.getEventById(id)
        if (event) {
          commit('SET_EVENT', event)
        } else {
          EventService.getEvent(id)
            .then(response => {
              commit('SET_EVENT', response.data)
            })
            .catch(error => {
              console.log('There was an error:', error.response) // <--- here
            })
        }
      }
```
Weâ€™ll switch that out for the same code we just added in our `fetchEvents` Action above.

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/store/modules/event.js**
```javascript
    ...
        .catch(error => {
          const notification = {
            type: 'error',
            message: 'There was a problem fetching an event: ' + error.message
          }
          dispatch('notification/add', notification, {
            root: true
          })
        })
    ...        
```
Now, when we get an error when our app tries to `fetchEvents` or `fetchEvent`, those errors will be added into our **notification** moduleâ€™s State.


----------
## Success and Error Notifications

Now thereâ€™s one more place in our code where we need to add some notification-based code. The difference here is we want to add both error notifications and also success notifications.

If we look in our **event** module, we see we have the `createEvent` Action.

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/store/modules/event.js**
```javascript
    createEvent({ commit }, event) {
      return EventService.postEvent(event).then(() => {
        commit('ADD_EVENT', event)
      })
    }
```
We can add to this Action so that when our event is posted to our mock database, we are also adding a success notification to our **notification** module. 

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/store/modules/event.js**
```javascript
    createEvent({ commit, dispatch }, event) {
      return EventService.postEvent(event)
        .then(() => {
          commit('ADD_EVENT', event)
          const notification = {
            type: 'success',
            message: 'Your event has been created!'
          }
          dispatch('notification/add', notification, { root: true })
        })
    }
```
This code should look quite familiar. Weâ€™re creating a `notification` object and passing it in as the payload when we *dispatch* the **notification** moduleâ€™s `add` action. 

Also, note that we added `dispatch` in the first argument from the context object so we could use it within the Action: `{ commit, dispatch }`

So far so good. But what if this event fails to be posted to our mock database?

We can add on a `catch` here to handle that:

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/store/modules/event.js**
```javascript
    ...
          dispatch('notification/add', notification, { root: true })
        })
        .catch(error => {
          const notification = {
            type: 'error',
            message: 'There was a problem creating your event: ' + error.message
          }
          dispatch('notification/add', notification, { root: true })
          throw error
        })
      
    }
```
Again, weâ€™re creating a new `notification` and sending it along as we *dispatch* the `add` Action.

Weâ€™ll also need to `throw` the `error` so that we can propagate it up to our component. Now looking in our **EventCreate** component, if that `error` was caught, we wonâ€™t `$router.push` to a new route, and we wonâ€™t clear out `this.event`. 

While weâ€™re here, we can delete where we were console logging errors here since itâ€™s no longer necessary.

```javascript
    createEvent() {
      this.$store.dispatch('event/createEvent', this.event).then(() => {
        this.$router.push({
          name: 'event-show',
          params: { id: this.event.id }
        })
        this.event = this.createFreshEventObject()
      })
      .catch(() => { // <-- delete
        console.log('There was a problem creating your event') // <-- delete
      })// <-- delete
```

----------
## Displaying our Notifications

Now that weâ€™ve added the ability for our Vuex code to create and Store notifications, weâ€™re going to want to display those notifications in our app. Weâ€™ll make a couple components to achieve that:


1. **NotificationBar.vue** will display the notification message itself
2. **NotificationContainer.vue** will create a **NotificationBar** for every notification in the State

Letâ€™s get started with our **NotificationBar**.

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/components/NotificationBar.vue**
```javascript
    <template>
      <div class="notification-bar">
        <p>{{ notification.message }}</p>
      </div>
    </template>
    
    <script>
    export default {
      props: {
        notification: {
          type: Object,
          required: true
        }
      }
    }
    </script>
    
    <style scoped>
    .notification-bar {
      margin: 1em 0 1em;
    }
    </style>
```
As you can see, in the `p` tag weâ€™re printing out the `notification.message`, which this component is receiving as a prop.

In order to style our success and error notifications differently, we can add a computed property that uses the `type` of our `notification` to create a class name.

```javascript
    ...
      computed: {
        notificationTypeClass() {
          return `-text-${this.notification.type}`
        }
```
This will return â€˜-text-successâ€™ or â€˜-text-errorâ€™ depending upon the `type` that is on our `notification` prop object, which will style our notification as black or red, respectively.

Now we just need to v-bind `notificationTypeClass` to a class on the div.

```html
      <div class="notification-bar" 
            :class="notificationTypeClass"> <-- binding computed property here
        <p>{{ notification.message }}</p>
      </div>
```

----------
## Nesting into NotificationContainer

Now we can create **NotificationContainer,** and use it to create our **NotificationBar** components.

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/components/NotificationContainer.vue**
```javascript
    <template>
      <div class="notification-container">
        <NotificationBar
          v-for="notification in notifications"
          :key="notification.id"
          :notification="notification"
        />
      </div>
    </template>
    
    <script>
    import NotificationBar from './NotificationBar'
    import { mapState } from 'vuex'
    
    export default {
      components: { NotificationBar },
      computed: mapState('notification', ['notifications'])
     }
    </script>
    
    <style scoped>
    .notification-container {
      position: fixed;
      bottom: 0;
    }
    </style>
```
As you can see, weâ€™re importing **NotificationBar** along with **mapState**. Then weâ€™re using `v-for` to create a **NotificationBar** for each of the `notifications` that are in our **notification** moduleâ€™s State, which weâ€™re mapped to within our computed property. 

Note how weâ€™re feeding in each `notification` as a prop when a **NotificationBar** is created, and using the `notification.id` as the unique key for each of the components that are created.

Now we just need to import **NotificationContainer** somewhere that can display it.


----------
## Adding NotificationContainer to our App.js

Since we want to display notifications globally, on the app level, weâ€™ll import **NotificationContainer** into the root component of our app: **App.vue**. Then weâ€™ll nest it in our **App**â€™s template, like so:

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/App.vue**
```javascript
    <template>
      <div id="app">
        <NavBar/>
        <NotificationContainer/>
        <router-view :key="$route.fullPath" />
      </div>
    </template>
    
    <script>
    import NavBar from '@/components/NavBar.vue'
    import NotificationContainer from '@/components/NotificationContainer.vue'
    
    export default {
      components: {
        NavBar,
        NotificationContainer
      }
    }
    </script>
```

----------
## Removing Notifications

Earlier, in our **notification** module, we added the ability to `remove` a notification. So when do we want that to happen? One way to achieve this is to show the notification to the user for a set amount of time, such as 5 seconds. And when that 5 seconds is up, the notification can delete itself. 

Letâ€™s look at how that could work. We can start by using `mapActions` to give our **NotificationBar** the ability to *dispatch* the `remove` Action.

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/components/NotificationBar.vue**
```javascript
    <script>
    import { mapActions } from 'vuex'
    ...
      props: {
        notification: {
          type: Object,
          required: true
        },
    ...
      methods: mapActions('notification', ['remove'])
    ...
    </script>
```

When we dispatch the Action, it will look like this: `this.remove(this.notification)`. Note that weâ€™re passing in the  `notification` prop as the payload.

So when do we want to fire `this.remove(this.notification)`? Like I said before, we can trigger it 5 seconds after the notification is displayed. Or in other words, 5 seconds after the **NotificationBar** component is mounted to the DOM. So letâ€™s put it in the `mounted` lifecycle hook.

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/components/NotificationBar.vue**
```javascript
    <script>
    ...
      data() {
        return {
          timeout: null
        }
      },
      mounted() {
        this.timeout = setTimeout(() => this.remove(this.notification), 5000)
      },
      methods: mapActions('notification', ['remove'])
    }
    </script>
```
Notice how weâ€™ve added `timeout` data and weâ€™re setting it to be equal to a `setTimeout` function, which dispatches the `remove` Action 5 seconds (5000ms) after the component is `mounted`. In other words, the component mounts, the notification is displayed, and 5 seconds later, the notification is deleted.

But why are we putting the `setTimeout` in our data? Couldnâ€™t we just call it directly from the `mounted` hook? Weâ€™re doing it this way because we want to make sure to clear the `setTimeout` just before this component is destroyed, like so:

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/components/NotificationBar.vue**
```javascript
    ...
      beforeDestroy() {
        clearTimeout(this.timeout)
      },
    ...
```
This will make sure we avoid a [memory leak](https://medium.com/outsystems-experts/beyond-memory-leaks-in-javascript-d27fd48ae67e) by not leaving the `setTimeout` running if this component isnâ€™t being actively displayed. Itâ€™s considered a JavaScript anti-pattern to not clear out your setTimeouts for this reason.

----------
## Letâ€™s ReVue

Whewâ€¦ that was a lot! In this lesson, we created a new **notifications** module then tweaked our Vuex code to add success and error notifications to that new moduleâ€™s State. We then learned how to remove those notifications. Finally, we created components that can display our notifications and trigger their removal.Within our application, we have some places in our Vuex code where we might be catching an error, like if our API call failed. Currently, weâ€™re just logging those errors to the console. But that isnâ€™t very helpful for our users, who should be informed when an error happens.

In this lesson, weâ€™ll be learning how to add notifications to our Vuex store when things like errors and successful actions occur, and then weâ€™ll explore how to display those notifications within our UI.


----------
## Problem: Need to Log and Display Notifications

These errors or successes may be happening in many different places in our app, in different components, and from different Vuex Actions. 

We need a way to log them so we can share that state across our application.


## Solution: A Vuex Module

Vuex is our best solution when we need shared state. In our last lesson, we learned about encapsulating Vuex code into modules. Now we need a new **notification** module that stores the State for our appâ€™s success and error notifications. Weâ€™ll then display those notifications to our user.

So letâ€™s create our **notification** module and make sure itâ€™s namespaced.

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/store/modules/notification.js**
```javascript
    export const namespaced = true
    
    export const state = {
      notifications: []
    }
```
As you can see, the `notifications` State is an array. Weâ€™ll want to be able to add a notification into it, and we also want the ability to remove a notification from it. So weâ€™ll add Mutations that handle those State changes.

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/store/modules/notification.js**
```javascript
    let nextId = 1
    
    export const mutations = {
      PUSH(state, notification) {
        state.notifications.push({
          ...notification,
          id: nextId++
        })
      },
      DELETE(state, notificationToRemove) {
        state.notifications = state.notifications.filter(
          notification => notification.id !== notificationToRemove.id
        )
      }
    }
```
Unsurprisingly, the `PUSH` Mutation pushes a new notification that it receives as a payload into the `notifications` State array. As it does so, it adds an `id` property to the notification, using the `nextId` variable thatâ€™s at the top of this file. This will make sure each new notification has a unique id, which weâ€™ll be using later.

The `DELETE` Mutation receives a `notificationToRemove` payload, which is used to filter the `notifications` and remove that specific notification from the State.

Finally, weâ€™ll want some dedicated Actions that can *commit* these Mutations.

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/store/modules/notification.js**
```javascript
    ...
    export const actions = {
      add({ commit }, notification) {
        commit('PUSH', notification)
      },
      remove({ commit }, notificationToRemove) {
        commit('DELETE', notificationToRemove)
      }
    }
```
The last step is to add this module to our **store.js** file.

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/store/store.js**
```javascript
    import * as notification from '@/store/modules/notification.js' // <-- import it
    
    export default new Vuex.Store({
      modules: {
        user,
        event,
        notification // <-- add it here
      },
```
Great. Now our **notification** module is ready to be used!


----------
## Adding Error Notifications

Currently, in the **event** module we created in the previous lesson, we have the `fetchEvents` Action, which makes an API call to get the events from our mock server. 

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/store/modules/event.js**
```javascript
    fetchEvents({ commit, dispatch }, { perPage, page }) {
      EventService.getEvents(perPage, page)
        .then(response => {
          commit('SET_EVENTS_TOTAL', parseInt(response.headers['x-total-count']))
          commit('SET_EVENTS', response.data)
        })
        .catch(error => {
          console.log('There was an error:', error.response) // <--- here
        })
    },
```
As you can see, if we `catch` an error, weâ€™re just logging it to the console. Instead, we want to *dispatch* the `add` Action that lives in our **notification** module, so we can add this error to our `notifications` State.

That would look like this:

```javascript
     ...
        .catch(error => {
          const notification = {
            type: 'error',
            message: 'There was a problem fetching events: ' + error.message
          }
          dispatch('notification/add', notification, { root: true })
        })
```
Notice above, weâ€™re creating a `notification` object, which has a `type` of `'``error``'` and a `message` that describes that error. 

Then weâ€™re passing that `notification` in as the payload where we are dispatching the Action. Since our notification module is namespaced, we can *dispatch* the `add` Action with `'notification/add'`. 

The third argument here, `{ root: true }`, is important. This tells `dispatch` to look for a `notification/add` action at the root of our store, instead of just looking for it inside the module weâ€™re currently in.


----------
## Testing it Out

Since our **EventList** page is what dispatches the `fetchEvents` Action, we can go to that page in our browser while the json-server is not running to test this out. With no mock server running, the API call will fail, and a notification error should be added to our Vuex State.

If we check the Vuex tab of the Vue DevTools we can see an error is definitely added to our `notifications` State. Great!

    fetchEvent({ commit, getters, dispatch }, id) {
        var event = getters.getEventById(id)
        if (event) {
          commit('SET_EVENT', event)
        } else {
          EventService.getEvent(id)
            .then(response => {
              commit('SET_EVENT', response.data)
            })
            .catch(error => {
              console.log('There was an error:', error.response) // <--- here
            })
        }
      }
```
Weâ€™ll switch that out for the same code we just added in our `fetchEvents` Action above.

          }
          dispatch('notification/add', notification, {
            root: true
          })
        })
    ...        
```
Now, when we get an error when our app tries to `fetchEvents` or `fetchEvent`, those errors will be added into our **notification** moduleâ€™s State.


----------
## Success and Error Notifications

Now thereâ€™s one more place in our code where we need to add some notification-based code. The difference here is we want to add both error notifications and also success notifications.

If we look in our **event** module, we see we have the `createEvent` Action.

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/store/modules/event.js**
```javascript
    createEvent({ commit }, event) {
      return EventService.postEvent(event).then(() => {
        commit('ADD_EVENT', event)
      })
    }
```
We can add to this Action so that when our event is posted to our mock database, we are also adding a success notification to our **notification** module. 

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/store/modules/event.js**
```javascript
    createEvent({ commit, dispatch }, event) {
      return EventService.postEvent(event)
        .then(() => {
          commit('ADD_EVENT', event)
          const notification = {
            type: 'success',
            message: 'Your event has been created!'
          }
          dispatch('notification/add', notification, { root: true })
        })
    }
```
This code should look quite familiar. Weâ€™re creating a `notification` object and passing it in as the payload when we *dispatch* the **notification** moduleâ€™s `add` action. 

Also, note that we added `dispatch` in the first argument from the context object so we could use it within the Action: `{ commit, dispatch }`

So far so good. But what if this event fails to be posted to our mock database?

We can add on a `catch` here to handle that:

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/store/modules/event.js**
```javascript
    ...
          dispatch('notification/add', notification, { root: true })
        })
        .catch(error => {
          const notification = {
            type: 'error',
            message: 'There was a problem creating your event: ' + error.message
          }
          dispatch('notification/add', notification, { root: true })
          throw error
        })
      
    }
```
Again, weâ€™re creating a new `notification` and sending it along as we *dispatch* the `add` Action.

Weâ€™ll also need to `throw` the `error` so that we can propagate it up to our component. Now looking in our **EventCreate** component, if that `error` was caught, we wonâ€™t `$router.push` to a new route, and we wonâ€™t clear out `this.event`. 

While weâ€™re here, we can delete where we were console logging errors here since itâ€™s no longer necessary.

```javascript
    createEvent() {
      this.$store.dispatch('event/createEvent', this.event).then(() => {
        this.$router.push({
          name: 'event-show',
          params: { id: this.event.id }
        })
        this.event = this.createFreshEventObject()
      })
      .catch(() => { // <-- delete
        console.log('There was a problem creating your event') // <-- delete
      })// <-- delete
```

----------
## Displaying our Notifications

Now that weâ€™ve added the ability for our Vuex code to create and Store notifications, weâ€™re going to want to display those notifications in our app. Weâ€™ll make a couple components to achieve that:


1. **NotificationBar.vue** will display the notification message itself
2. **NotificationContainer.vue** will create a **NotificationBar** for every notification in the State

Letâ€™s get started with our **NotificationBar**.

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/components/NotificationBar.vue**
```javascript
    <template>
      <div class="notification-bar">
        <p>{{ notification.message }}</p>
      </div>
    </template>
    
    <script>
    export default {
      props: {
        notification: {
          type: Object,
          required: true
        }
      }
    }
    </script>
    
    <style scoped>
    .notification-bar {
      margin: 1em 0 1em;
    }
    </style>
```
As you can see, in the `p` tag weâ€™re printing out the `notification.message`, which this component is receiving as a prop.

In order to style our success and error notifications differently, we can add a computed property that uses the `type` of our `notification` to create a class name.

```javascript
    ...
      computed: {
        notificationTypeClass() {
          return `-text-${this.notification.type}`
        }
```
This will return â€˜-text-successâ€™ or â€˜-text-errorâ€™ depending upon the `type` that is on our `notification` prop object, which will style our notification as black or red, respectively.

Now we just need to v-bind `notificationTypeClass` to a class on the div.

```html
      <div class="notification-bar" 
            :class="notificationTypeClass"> <-- binding computed property here
        <p>{{ notification.message }}</p>
      </div>
```

----------
## Nesting into NotificationContainer

Now we can create **NotificationContainer,** and use it to create our **NotificationBar** components.

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/components/NotificationContainer.vue**
```javascript
    <template>
      <div class="notification-container">
        <NotificationBar
          v-for="notification in notifications"
          :key="notification.id"
          :notification="notification"
        />
      </div>
    </template>
    
    <script>
    import NotificationBar from './NotificationBar'
    import { mapState } from 'vuex'
    
    export default {
      components: { NotificationBar },
      computed: mapState('notification', ['notifications'])
     }
    </script>
    
    <style scoped>
    .notification-container {
      position: fixed;
      bottom: 0;
    }
    </style>
```
As you can see, weâ€™re importing **NotificationBar** along with **mapState**. Then weâ€™re using `v-for` to create a **NotificationBar** for each of the `notifications` that are in our **notification** moduleâ€™s State, which weâ€™re mapped to within our computed property. 

Note how weâ€™re feeding in each `notification` as a prop when a **NotificationBar** is created, and using the `notification.id` as the unique key for each of the components that are created.

Now we just need to import **NotificationContainer** somewhere that can display it.


----------
## Adding NotificationContainer to our App.js

Since we want to display notifications globally, on the app level, weâ€™ll import **NotificationContainer** into the root component of our app: **App.vue**. Then weâ€™ll nest it in our **App**â€™s template, like so:

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/App.vue**
```javascript
    <template>
      <div id="app">
        <NavBar/>
        <NotificationContainer/>
        <router-view :key="$route.fullPath" />
      </div>
    </template>
    
    <script>
    import NavBar from '@/components/NavBar.vue'
    import NotificationContainer from '@/components/NotificationContainer.vue'
    
    export default {
      components: {
        NavBar,
        NotificationContainer
      }
    }
    </script>
```

----------
## Removing Notifications

Earlier, in our **notification** module, we added the ability to `remove` a notification. So when do we want that to happen? One way to achieve this is to show the notification to the user for a set amount of time, such as 5 seconds. And when that 5 seconds is up, the notification can delete itself. 

Letâ€™s look at how that could work. We can start by using `mapActions` to give our **NotificationBar** the ability to *dispatch* the `remove` Action.

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/components/NotificationBar.vue**
```javascript
    <script>
    import { mapActions } from 'vuex'
    ...
      props: {
        notification: {
          type: Object,
          required: true
        },
    ...
      methods: mapActions('notification', ['remove'])
    ...
    </script>
```

When we dispatch the Action, it will look like this: `this.remove(this.notification)`. Note that weâ€™re passing in the  `notification` prop as the payload.

So when do we want to fire `this.remove(this.notification)`? Like I said before, we can trigger it 5 seconds after the notification is displayed. Or in other words, 5 seconds after the **NotificationBar** component is mounted to the DOM. So letâ€™s put it in the `mounted` lifecycle hook.

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/components/NotificationBar.vue**
```javascript
    <script>
    ...
      data() {
        return {
          timeout: null
        }
      },
      mounted() {
        this.timeout = setTimeout(() => this.remove(this.notification), 5000)
      },
      methods: mapActions('notification', ['remove'])
    }
    </script>
```
Notice how weâ€™ve added `timeout` data and weâ€™re setting it to be equal to a `setTimeout` function, which dispatches the `remove` Action 5 seconds (5000ms) after the component is `mounted`. In other words, the component mounts, the notification is displayed, and 5 seconds later, the notification is deleted.

But why are we putting the `setTimeout` in our data? Couldnâ€™t we just call it directly from the `mounted` hook? Weâ€™re doing it this way because we want to make sure to clear the `setTimeout` just before this component is destroyed, like so:

ðŸ“ƒ **/src/components/NotificationBar.vue**
```javascript
    ...
      beforeDestroy() {
        clearTimeout(this.timeout)
      },
    ...
```
This will make sure we avoid a [memory leak](https://medium.com/outsystems-experts/beyond-memory-leaks-in-javascript-d27fd48ae67e) by not leaving the `setTimeout` running if this component isnâ€™t being actively displayed. Itâ€™s considered a JavaScript anti-pattern to not clear out your setTimeouts for this reason.

----------
## Letâ€™s ReVue

Whewâ€¦ that was a lot! In this lesson, we created a new **notifications** module then tweaked our Vuex code to add success and error notifications to that new moduleâ€™s State. We then learned how to remove those notifications. Finally, we created components that can display our notifications and trigger their removal.
