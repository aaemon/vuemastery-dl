# Timelines with GSAP

When working with GSAP, often our animations start to increase in complexity. There comes a point where a simple tween isn't sufficient and we need to create multiple animations that work together in a sequence. For this, we can use GSAP's timeline feature, which allows us to chain a group of tweens together to create more complex animations that work together as one. 

---

## Our first Timeline

Let's start by taking at the **Timeline.vue** component in our starting code.

ðŸ“ƒ **src/views/Timeline.vue**
```html
<template>
  <div>
    <img class="runner first" src="../assets/runner.png" alt="runner" />
    <img class="runner second" src="../assets/runner.png" alt="runner" />
    <img class="runner third" src="../assets/runner.png" alt="runner" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import gsap from 'gsap'

export default {
  mounted() {
    // timeline will go here
  }
}
</script>

<style scoped>
.runner {
  display: block;
  height: 5em;
  width: 5em;
  margin-top: 1.5em;
}
</style>
```
In the template, we have three images of runners. In a moment, we are going to make each of them "race" to the right side of the browser. Since we already have `gsap` imported into this component, we just need to initialize our timeline, which we'll do in our `mounted` hook.

ðŸ“ƒ **src/views/Timeline.vue**
```javascript
mounted() {
	let tl = gsap.timeline()
}
```
 

Here, we'll also add a tween for each runner onto the timeline. Let's start with the first runner:

ðŸ“ƒ **src/views/Timeline.vue**
```javascript
mounted() {
	let tl = gsap.timeline()
	tl.to('.first', { x: 700, duration: 2, ease: 'expo.out' })
}
```
Here, we're using the `to` method like we've used in previous lessons. This method allows us to create a tween and apply it to the target (the element we're animating). In this case, we are animating the element with the class name of `'.first'`. We're telling that element to "run" `700` pixels to the right, over a `duration` of `2` seconds, and giving that motion an `ease` called `'expo.out'`.

If we check this out in the browser, we'll see that runner "race" 700px over to the right. So far so good, now let's create two more `to` tweens, one for each of the remaining runners.

ðŸ“ƒ **src/views/Timeline.vue**
```javascript
mounted() {
	...
	tl.to('.first', { x: 700, duration: 2, ease: 'expo.out' })
	tl.to('.second', { x: 700, duration: 2, ease: 'expo.out' })
  tl.to('.third', { x: 700, duration: 2, ease: 'expo.out' })
}
```
Now, when this component is `mounted`, each of our runners "race" `700` pixels `to` the right. As it stands, our runners "take off" one after the other. After the `first` runner reaches its destination, the `second` runner goes, then the `third` after that. However, what if we wanted our runners to take off at the same time? Or what if we wanted the `second` runner to start a half second after the `first` runner goes?

## Position Parameter

We can alter the timing that animations within our timeline fire by using the the [position parameter](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline). This parameter lets us define when a tween occurs within the timeline's sequence, and there are several ways for us to set that position. 

### Absolute Position

One way to set the position of a tween within a timeline is by setting its absolution position. This means we provide an integer value, which represents the value of seconds from the start of the animation. So if we wanted an animation to fire a half second into the timeline, we'd set that animation's position value as `0.5`, like so:

ðŸ“ƒ **src/views/Timeline.vue**
```javascript
mounted() {
	...
	tl.to('.first', { x: 200, duration: 2, ease: 'expo.out' })
	tl.to('.second', { x: 400, duration: 2, ease: 'expo.out' }, 0.5) // now with an absolute position
  tl.to('.third', { x: 600, duration: 2, ease: 'expo.out' })
}
```
Now, the `second` runner will start "running" `0.5` seconds into the sequence. 

### Relative Position

Sometimes it may be more useful for us if the position of our animations are set in relation to other animations. To set a relative position, we use a string like `'-=.75'` or `+=.75` to set the start of one tween `.75` seconds *before* (`-=`) or *after* (`+=`) the end of the animation before it. So let's add a relative position to the `second` tween in our timeline.

ðŸ“ƒ **src/views/Timeline.vue**
```javascript
mounted() {
	...
	tl.to('.first', { x: 200, duration: 2, ease: 'expo.out' })
	tl.to('.second', { x: 400, duration: 2, ease: 'expo.out' }, '-=.75')
  tl.to('.third', { x: 600, duration: 2, ease: 'expo.out' })
}
```
![https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1576524372145_timelines.001.opt.jpg?alt=media&token=53ed2627-9b9f-400a-98c6-58e8d2a57b0d](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1576524372145_timelines.001.opt.jpg?alt=media&token=53ed2627-9b9f-400a-98c6-58e8d2a57b0d)

Now the `second` animation will start `.75` seconds *before* the `first` one ends. 

---

### Start/End Position

If we wanted our `second` animation to start at the same time as our `first`, you might think we would change the `second` animation's position parameter to `-=2`. 

ðŸ“ƒ **src/views/Timeline.vue**
```javascript
mounted() {
	...
	tl.to('.first', { x: 200, duration: 2, ease: 'expo.out' })
	tl.to('.second', { x: 400, duration: 2, ease: 'expo.out' }, '-=2')
  tl.to('.third', { x: 600, duration: 2, ease: 'expo.out' })
}
```
This would work for now, but what if we need to change the `duration` of our `first` animation later on? For example, if the `first` animation's duration changed to `4`, then our `second` animation's position would only move back halfway toward the start of our `first` because 4-2=2.  If we want the `first` and `second` tweens to fire at the same time regardless of how long our `first` runner's `duration` is, we can achieve that by using a third way of setting position: `<`

When we set the position of our `second` runner as `'<'`, that tells it to always start when the `first` animation *starts*. Alternatively, `'>'` tells it to start when the `first` animation *ends*.

ðŸ“ƒ **src/views/Timeline.vue**
```javascript
mounted() {
	...
	tl.to('.first', { x: 200, duration: 2, ease: 'expo.out' })
	tl.to('.second', { x: 400, duration: 2, ease: 'expo.out' }, '<') // starts when first tween starts
  tl.to('.third', { x: 600, duration: 2, ease: 'expo.out' },  '<') // starts when second tween starts, which is when first tween starts
}
```
In the code above, all three runners will start at the same time. Why? Well, we're telling our `third` runner to start when the `second` runner does, and the `second` runner starts when the `first` runner does.

![https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1576524376652_timelines.002.opt.jpg?alt=media&token=fd670385-7432-4e19-9e7f-66d3cf9c5f8f](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1576524376652_timelines.002.opt.jpg?alt=media&token=fd670385-7432-4e19-9e7f-66d3cf9c5f8f)

We can also add to these to make them relative. For example, what do you think a position of `'<0.5'` would do?

ðŸ“ƒ **src/views/Timeline.vue**
```javascript
mounted() {
	...
	tl.to('.first', { x: 200, duration: 2, ease: 'expo.out' })
	tl.to('.second', { x: 400, duration: 2, ease: 'expo.out' }, '<0.5') // What will this do?
  tl.to('.third', { x: 600, duration: 2, ease: 'expo.out' }) 
}
```
If you guessed that the `second` animation would fire a half second after the start of the `first`, taking the `third` along with it, then you're correct. 

As you can see, there are a lot of different ways to position animations within a timeline, including even more that you can [check out here](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline).

## **Timeline Duration**

With a simple timeline like this, we can quite easily count up the timeline's total duration. However, in more complex timelines, we can run `tl.duration()` and that would add up all of our tweens' individual durations and return our timeline's total duration for us. This may be helpful when deciding where to position the tweens within your timeline's sequence.

---

## Repeating / Looping Timelines

You may have the need to repeat or even loop a timeline. We can easily achieve that by passing in an object when creating our timeline, like so:
```javascript
gsap.timeline({ repeat: 2 })
```
Now, our timeline will repeat itself twice. If we wanted it to repeat indefinitely on a loop, we'd use `-1`.
```javascript
gsap.timeline({ repeat: -1 })
```
There's also the ability to add a delay before the next repetition.
```javascript
gsap.timeline({ repeat: -1, repeatDelay: 1 })
```
Now this timeline will wait `1` second before starting over.

## Let's ReVue

In this lesson, we saw how gsap timeline's allows us to sequence multiple animations, adding or removing space between them with the position parameter. In the next and final lesson of the course, we'll see how we can create more flexible and scalable animations by using nested timelines.
