# User Login

Now that we’ve learned how to register users into our app, we can move forward and implement the ability for already-registered users to log into the accounts they’ve created. 

In this lesson, we’ll create a new **LoginUser.vue** component, add some routing to our app to smooth out the user experience, and organize some of our Vuex code.


----------
## Creating our Login Component

We are already familiar with creating the **RegisterUser** component, which took in the user’s name, email and password in order to register them with our app. The **LoginUser** component will behave very similarly, with some minor differences.

One of the main differences is that we no longer need the user’s name, just their email and password, so our component data will look like this:

📃 **src/views/LoginUser.vue**
```
      data () {
        return {
          email: '',
          password: ''
        }
      },
```
Which means the template will need `input` elements that are bound to these values, like so:

📃 **src/views/LoginUser.vue**
```
    <template>
      <div>
        <form @submit.prevent="login">
          <label for="email">
            Email:
          </label>
          <input v-model="email" type="email" name="email" value>
          
          <label for="password">
            Password:
          </label>
          <input v-model="password" type="password" name="password" value>
      
          <button type="submit" name="button">
            Login
          </button>
        </form>
      </div>
    </template>
```
The other difference here is instead of calling the `register` method when the form is submitted, we are calling the `login` method, which we can write now.

📃 **src/views/LoginUser.vue**
```
      methods: {
        login () {
          this.$store
            .dispatch('login', {
              email: this.email,
              password: this.password
            })
            .then(() => { this.$router.push({ name: 'dashboard' }) })
        }
      }
```
This method `dispatches` the `login` Vuex action (which we’ll get to in a moment) and sends an object containing the user’s `email` and `password` when dispatching. Notice how we are `then` redirecting to the `dashboard` route, just like our **RegisterUser** component does.

Pretty straightforward, huh? So what’s the `login` Action look like? Let’s head to the Vuex **store.js** file and write that out.


----------
## Vuex: The login Action

The `login` Action will also behave similarly to how our `register` Action works. We’ll need it to make an axios post request, but this time to the server’s `/login` endpoint, sending along the credentials the user input in the **LoginUser** component.

**📃src/store.js**
```
      login ({ commit }, credentials) {
        return axios
          .post('//localhost:3000/login', credentials)
          .then(({ data }) => {
            commit('SET_USER_DATA', data)
          })
      }
```
When the server response is returned, we’re taking that `data` and passing it in as the payload when we commit the `SET_USER_DATA` Mutation.

Conceptually, there’s not much new happening here. But let’s get clear on what is actually happening on the server-side when that `/login` endpoint is hit.


----------
## Server Login Behavior 

When we `post` out to our example server’s `/login` endpoint, this will cause the server to read the **user.json** file in our mock database, and check if the email and password in that file match the email and password that we just sent as credentials. If they match, a new JWT token is created and sent back within the response data.

This means that when our `login` Action commits the `SET_USER_DATA` Mutation, we’re doing exactly what we did in the previous lesson:


1. Storing the userData in our Vuex State
2. Storing a copy of the userData in local storage
3. Adding the token from the userData into our Axios header

Since we’ll then have a JWT token in the axios header, we should be successfully accessing our private event data when we’re redirected to the dashboard route (which calls out for those private events).

We’re almost ready to try this out in the browser, but first we need to add **LoginUser** into our **router.js** so we can access it.


----------
## Adding LoginUser as a route

We’ll just import the file and add it to the `routes` array.

**📃src/router.js**
```
    import LoginUser from './views/LoginUser.vue'
    ...
      routes: [
        ...
        {
          path: '/login',
          name: 'login',
          component: LoginUser
        }
      ]
```

----------
## Testing it out

Now let’s head into our browser and test to see if this all works. We’ll go to *localhost:8080/login*, which brings us to the login component. We’ll login with whatever email and password is currently saved in the **user.json** file of our mock database. 

(Remember, this backend is not a production-ready solution; it’s only storing one user at a time so you’ll need to log in with the same info you most recently registered with.)

When we do so and hit the login button, we are successfully redirected to the dashboard, which displays our private events.

Great! Now we just have a few more steps remaining for this lesson.


----------
## Adding Router Links

Right now, we have to manually type in a url such as *localhost:8080/login* or *localhost:8080/register*. We need to add to our user interface so the user has some links they can click on to route them to these paths.

So let’s head into our **Home.vue** component and start that process. In our template we’ll add a welcome message, like so:

**📃src/views/Home.vue**
```
      <div>
        To use this app you'll need to
        <router-link to="/login">
          Login
        </router-link>
        or
        <router-link to="/register">
          Register
        </router-link>
      </div>
```
Now when someone lands on our site’s homepage, they are prompted to login to their account or register to create one.

So far so good, but what if a visitor is at the `/login` route but they realize they need to create an account? They would have to go back to the home page and then click on the “register” `router-link`. We’d have the same problem if a visitor is at `/register` but they need to be at the `/login` route because they realized they already have an account. 

We can add `router-links` to the bottom of the **LoginUser** and **RegisterUser** components to solve this issue and improve our user experience.

**📃src/views/LoginUser.vue**    
```
    <form>
    ...
      <button type="submit" name="button">
        Login
      </button>
    
      <router-link to="/register">
        Don't have an account? Register.
      </router-link>
    </form>
```
**📃src/views/RegisterUser.vue**
```
    <form>
    ...
      <button type="submit" name="button">
        Login
      </button>
    
      <router-link to="/login">
        Already have an account? Login.
      </router-link>
    </form>
```
Now our user has a convenient way to navigate to the route they need. Yay UX!


----------
## Adding a Login Button

Additionally, we can add a button to our navbar that prompts a user to login as well. Let’s head into our **AppNav.vue** component and add a button there.

**📃src/components/AppNav.vue**
```
    ...
    <router-link to="/login" class="button">
      Login
    </router-link>
    ...
```
Now, at the bottom of our template, we have a `router-link` styled like a button. So if we check the browser, that’ll appear at the top-right corner, like we’ve seen in many web apps before.


![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578372753741_1.png?alt=media&token=9fd79f70-0a6e-44a3-a6b0-7e8072955f48)


Great. Now our app has convenient ways for a user to navigate between our **LoginUser** and **RegisterUser** components. But once a user is logged in, they probably shouldn’t be seeing prompts for them to login or register, since they’ve clearly already done that. We can solve for that by using some Vuex State we already have.


----------
## Removing router-links when logged in

If our user is logged in, they probably shouldn’t see router-links prompting them to login. So we can hide those router-links when we know we have a user in our Vuex State.

Technically, we can use `this.$store.state.user` as an expression to determine whether we display the router-links that prompt logging in/registering, like so:

**📃src/views/Home.vue**
```
    <template>
      ...
       <template v-if="!this.$store.state.user">
          <div>
            To use this app you'll need to
            <router-link to="/login">
              Login
            </router-link>
            or
            <router-link to="/register">
              Register
            </router-link>
          </div>
        </template>
      ...
    </template>
```
While this works, it’s not the most ideal solution, for a few reasons. We want our templates to be as readable as possible. We might have a designer on our team who doesn’t know Vuex, for example. Also, as our app grows, our Vuex store will evolve. We might break our store into modules and/or rename items in our State, which would require us to update every `v-if` statement that relies on our Vuex store being structured in a specific way. 

A more ideal solution is to use a getter that tells us whether we have a user logged in or not, and make that getter accessible from anyone component that may need it.

So we let’s first create that `loggedIn` getter:

**📃src/store.js**
```
    ...
      getters: {
        loggedIn (state) {
          return !!state.user
        }
      }
    ...
```
If this `!!` syntax is new to you, just know it helps us determine the truthiness or falsiness of the value. So this getter will return `true` if we have a user stored in our state, and `false` when that state is null.


----------

Now let’s start to make this getter accessible to any component that needs it.

Inside our **src** directory, we’ll create a new **vuex** folder, and move our **store.js** file into it. Inside of that **vuex** folder, we’ll then create a new **helpers.js** file. As you might imagine, we can use this file to import Vuex helpers, specifically `mapGetters`.

**📃src/vuex/helpers.js**
```
    import { mapGetters } from 'vuex'
    
    export const authComputed = {
      ...mapGetters(['loggedIn'])
    }
```
Notice how we’re then exporting `authComputed`, which uses the `mapGetters` helper to map to the `loggedIn` getter that we just added to our **store.js** file. 

Now we can import this vuex helper into the components that need it, such as the **Home** component.

**📃src/views/Home.vue**
```
    <script>
    import { authComputed } from '../vuex/helpers.js'
    
    export default {
      computed: {
        ...authComputed
      }
    }
    </script>
```
After importing, we can add `authComputed` as a computed property, this component will then have access to everything that lives within `authComputed`, which includes the `loggedIn` getter.

So in our template, instead of `<template v-if="!this.$store.state.user">`, we can use our getter: `loggedIn`

**📃src/views/Home.vue**
```
    <template>
      ...
        <div v-if="!loggedIn">
          To use this app you'll need to
          <router-link to="/login">
            Login
          </router-link>
          or
          <router-link to="/register">
            Register
          </router-link>
        </div>
      ...
    </template>
```
Great. Now we will only display this welcome message when we’ve determined that there is not already a user in our State.


----------

We can repeat this process in the our **AppNav** component, which also needs to hide a router-link when we have a user logged in.

**📃src/components/AppNav.vue**
```
    <template>
      <div id="nav">
        ...
        <router-link v-if="!loggedIn" to="/login" class="button">
          Login
        </router-link>
      </div>
    </template>
    
    <script>
    import { authComputed } from '../vuex/helpers.js'
    export default {
      computed: {
        ...authComputed
      }
    }
    </script>
```
Here, we’ve imported `authComputed`, added it as a computed property, and added `v-if="!loggedIn"` to the router-link that we need to display or not.


----------
## Let’s ReVue

In this lesson, we covered how to log in users who had already registered with our app, then added conditionally displaying navigational links to smooth out the user experience, relying on some effective Vuex reorganization to provide a more scalable (and readable) solution.

In the next lesson, we’ll cover the process of effectively logging *out* a user.
