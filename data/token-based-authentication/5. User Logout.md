# User Logout

Now that we understand how to log users into our app, we can start thinking about what it takes to successfully log a user *out* of our app. As you might expect, logging a user out will essentially require us to reverse the steps we took when we logged a user in. This means we'll need to remove the user data from our Vuex State, remove the user data from our local storage, and take the JWT token out of our axios Authorization header. Let's get started adding all of this functionality.


----------
# Creating a Logout Button

First, we need to add to our user interface. We'll add a simple way for a user to log out of our app. Just like we have a **Login** button that shows up in our navbar when a user is not logged in, we can add a **Logout** button to our navbar, which shows up when a user *is* logged in.
Let's head into our **AppNav** component and add that button now.

**src/components/AppNav.vue**
```
    <router-link v-if="!loggedIn" to="/login" class="button">
            Login
    </router-link>
    
    <button v-else type="button" class="logoutButton" @click="logout">
            Logout
    </button>
```
Notice how we placed the **Logout** button just below the **Login** button. We did this so that we could simply add a `v-else` onto it so it will show up whenever the **Login** button is not showing up. In other words: the **Logout** button will show up whenever a user is logged in. In addition to having a `logoutButton` class, our button is also triggering a method with `@click="logout"`
So what does that `logout` method need to do? We'll want it to `dispatch` a Vuex Action called `logout`, so let's add that method now inside our **AppNav** component.

📄 **src/components/AppNav.vue**
```
    methods: {
        logout () {
          this.$store.dispatch('logout')
        }
      }
```
Now we can head into our Vuex store and get this `logout` behavior working.

----------
# Adding to the Store

Let's add our `logout` Action.
📄 **src/vuex/store.js**
```
    logout ({ commit }) {
      commit('LOGOUT')
    }
```
As you can see, this simply `commits` the `LOGOUT` Mutation. Before we write that Mutation, let's pause a moment to think about what needs to happen inside of it. Like I mentioned earlier, when we log a user *out* of the app, we are essentially reversing the login steps. Or in other words, we are reversing what we accomplished with the `SET_USER_DATA` Mutation, which looks like this:

📄 **src/vuex/store.js**
```
    SET_USER_DATA (state, userData) {
      state.user = userData
      localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(userData))
      axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${
        userData.token
      }`
    }
```
It's setting the `userData` into our `user` State, setting the `userData` in local storage, and setting the `token` as the axios Authorization header. So to reverse this, we could write something like:

📄**src/vuex/store.js**
```
    LOGOUT (state) {
            state.user = null
      localStorage.removeItem('user')
      axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = null
    }
```
But there is actually a simpler and more scalable way to achieve this, which looks like:

📄**src/vuex/store.js**
```
    LOGOUT () {
      localStorage.removeItem('user')
      location.reload()
    }
```
Here, we are still manually removing the `user` from our local storage, but we're using `location.reload()` to handle clearing out the Vuex State and axios header. If you're not familiar with this [reload](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/reload) method, it is essentially forcing a refresh of our page. And since Vuex State does not survive a browser refresh, it takes care of clearing our `user` State for us. Additionally, it clears our axios Authorization header as well.

So with one forced refresh, we handled both steps we needed, and have proactively built-in some scalability here. How? Well if you imagine our app growing, we'd probably break our Vuex into modules. This means we'd likely need to rewrite the way we are clearing our `user` State, which eventually may not live in the same file as the Mutation that is trying to clear it. So `reload()` is a handy trick to save us some headache down the line.

# Checking the browser

If we check this out in the browser, we'll see that when we click the **Logout** button, it works as expected. And if we're on the Dashboard route, we'll see that the page displays "Loading events..." and the console gives us a `401` error (which our mock server sent back since it did not receive the correct request credentials).
So far so good! But it doesn't make sense for us to allow a user who is not logged in to access this Dashboard route, since they won't have the proper permissions to view the events that we display here anyway. So we can head into our **router.js** file and make sure that when a user logs out (or was never logged in to begin with) they can't access our Dashboard, or any other private route within our app.


----------
# Blocking private routes

In order to block access to a private route via Vue Router, we can use a [navigation guard](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/navigation-guards.html#global-before-guards), which we learned about in our Next-Level Vue course.
Our first step will be to make use of the [meta](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/meta.html#route-meta-fields) tag, which can be used to add protections to a given route. So let's make it so that the dashboard route `requiresAuth`.

📄 **src/router.js**
```
    {
      path: '/dashboard',
      name: 'dashboard',
      component: Dashboard,
      meta: { requiresAuth: true }
    },
```
Now we can start building out our `beforeEach` method, which receives three arguments:
`to` : the route being navigated *to*
`from`: the current route being navigated away *from*
`next` the function called to resolve the hook

📄**src/router.js**
```
    router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
            // now what?
    })
```
What do we need to happen inside this guard? First, we'll need to know a couple things:

1. Do we have a user logged in?
2. Does the route being navigated `to` `requireAuth`?

So let's handle step one. We can find that out by simply checking our local storage, like so:

📄 **src/router.js**
```
    router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
      const loggedIn = localStorage.getItem('user')
    })
```
Now we can check if the route being navigated to `requiresAuth`:

📄 **src/router.js**
```
    router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
      const loggedIn = localStorage.getItem('user')
    
            if (to.matched.some(record => record.meta.requiresAuth)) {
                    // now what?
            }
    })
```
Here we are saying `if` the route being navigated `to` matches one of our routes (`record`) where the meta tag includes `requiresAuth = true`, then we'll do something. What do we want to do now? We need to see if we have a user `loggedIn`. If not, then we will redirect to the home route and `return` the function.

📄 **src/router.js**
```
    router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
      const loggedIn = localStorage.getItem('user')
    
            if (to.matched.some(record => record.meta.requiresAuth)) {
                    if (!loggedIn) {
          next('/')
              return
        }
                next()
              }
    })
```
Otherwise, the function continues to run and we'll hit the second `next()` and fulfill that route request. And we need to add a third `next()` outside of the initial `if` statement so that we can fulfill the route request if the route is simply public.

📄**src/router.js**
```
    router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
      const loggedIn = localStorage.getItem('user')
    
      if (to.matched.some(record => record.meta.requiresAuth)) {
        if (!loggedIn) {
          next('/')
              return
        }
        next()
      }
    
      next()
    })
```
If you’re looking at this code and wondering, “Can’t this be done with less code?” You’re right! This is how we could simplify it further:

📄**src/router.js**
```
    router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
      const loggedIn = localStorage.getItem('user')
      if (to.matched.some(record => record.meta.requiresAuth) && !loggedIn) {
        next('/')
      }
      next()
    })
```

Great. Now every time we navigate to a new route ( `beforeEach` ), we are checking if that route requires authentication and if we have a user logged in. If it does require authentication and we don't have a user, we'll redirect to our home route. Otherwise, we can fulfill that route request. We're almost done, there's just one little feature we need to add.


----------
# Hiding the Dashboard Link

If we check this out in the browser, we can see when we hit the **Logout** button, not only are we logged out, but since we no longer have the permission to access the guarded Dashboard route, we are redirected to the home page. But we can still see the Dashboard link in the navbar.
Even though that link won't take us to the guarded route when we click on it, that's even more of a reason to hide it when a user is logged out. So let's head into our **AppNav** component and make sure it won't show up when it shouldn't.

📄**src/components/AppNav.vue**
```
    <router-link v-if="loggedIn" to="/dashboard">
      Dashboard
    </router-link>
```
By simply adding `v-if="loggedIn"`, we will show this button only when a user is logged in. This is similar to the previous lesson, where we hid the **Login** button whenever a user was not logged in.

# Let's ReVue

In this lesson, we successfully added the functionality to log a user out of our app, which means we reversed our login steps, and we even learned how to use the `reload` method to make this logout functionality more scalable from the get-go. In the next lesson, we'll learn how to handle the errors that happen when people attempt to log into our app incorrectly.
