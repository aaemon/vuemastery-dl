# Universal Mode

When we generated our example project in the previous lesson we had to choose between generating a Universal or SPA mode application.   We selected Universal mode, and in this lesson we‚Äôll begin to understand what benefits that gives our Nuxt.js application.

## üõë Problem: Single Page Apps can load slow

As we talked about when introducing Vue Router in our Real World Vue course, in a normal web application when the user requests `http://myapp.com/about-us` the server normally returns `about-us.html`.  However, in a single page application any route request (even `/about-us`) will return `index.html`.  This index file requires all the Vue JavaScript files, and once Vue is instantiated Vue Router will load up and render the `about-us` page.  Visualized on a timeline it looks something like this:

This can be slower than you might want, especially on slow internet connections.  Why?  A browser needs to do a lot:

- Download the index.html
- Download the Vue application JavaScript
- Initialize the Vue app
- Initialize Vue Router and route to proper components
- Do any additional API calls to fetch data to render
- Render templates to the page

Once loaded and running Single Page Applications like this are pretty fast, however that initial load can be slow.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Solution: Universal Mode

When we created our application we selected **Universal Mode**, which means that when our application is initially loaded, it will render the page requested on the server-side first, before sending over the initial HTML.  On a timeline it looks something like this:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578373459128_1.jpg?alt=media&token=a64e156d-8805-44a8-b57b-b41a3a1c5c46)

As you can see, the new page is shown before downloading and running any JavaScript.  Once JavaScript is downloaded and run Vue is started up and the page ‚ÄúHydrated,‚Äù which basically means it turns into a normal SPA (Single Page App).

You might wonder what happens with Nuxt after Vue starts in the browser, and another link (like `/about-us` is clicked.  Here‚Äôs what that looks like:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578373467826_2.jpg?alt=media&token=7db6c5fb-e6ee-45a5-b37a-41c648f2a57f)


What to notice here is that a JavaScript request is made to pull over just the JavaScript needed to render the `/about-us` page component.  This is because Nuxt uses code-splitting by default and will split each of our pages into different JavaScript files which are loaded only when needed.  This way our application isn‚Äôt downloading a ton of component code up front that may or may not ever be loaded.

However, if the user then clicks to go back to the `/create` page, it doesn‚Äôt do another request for JavaScript, as it had loaded this initially.

## Exploring Universal Mode

To explore our example universal app, we can start up the app we created in the lesson in production mode by first running:

```
    $ npm run build
```

This command is going to create compiled JavaScript files for both our server and client side, and split each of our page components into different files.

Then to start up our app in production & universal mode we run:

```
    $ npm start
```

Now if we fire up our browser, and disable JavaScript, we find that the initial page HTML is completely rendering out the page.  Even without Vue, the HTML page quickly gets rendered.

If we activate JavaScript and reload the page the initial html will get loaded and displayed, JavaScript files downloaded, Vue instantiated, and the page hydrated.

Then if we navigate to the `/create` route, we can look in DevTools and see that the JavaScript for that particular route was loaded and run.  Plus if we inspect the file that gets sent over, we can see the compiled template which creates a Virtual Node.

  ‚û°Ô∏è **Side Note:** If you‚Äôre not familiar with Virtual Nodes and want to learn more about what happens inside the code in Vue, I highly recommend checking out our Advanced Components course on Vue Mastery.
## Smart Prefetching

There‚Äôs a newer feature of Nuxt.js that was released in Nuxt 2.4, called Smart prefetching which, combined with Universal mode, provides an even better user experience.  With this feature (turned on by default) Nuxt.js will automatically prefetch code-split pages linked with `<nuxt-link>` when these links are visible in the viewport.  

Notice in the video below, that when I scroll up to the navigation, the create `nuxt-link` becomes visible, and the JavaScript for that page is pre-loaded, even before I click on it.  Now when it click on it, the JavaScript will be ready to execute immediately, instead of waiting for a network request.

## To ReVue

As you can see, Universal mode helps increase the speed of initial page loading while smart prefetching increases the speed of pages that are code-split.  Increased speed leads to an improved user experience, and we all want that.
