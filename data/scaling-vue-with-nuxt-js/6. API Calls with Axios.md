# API Calls with Axios

Since weâ€™re creating a Universal application the way we call our API needs to be slightly different.  In this lesson weâ€™ll learn how to setup a dummy db to run API calls, how to write our first API calls using Axios with Promises, and finally how to setup proper error handling.

## Where the APIs get Called

Letâ€™s take a look at where the API gets called when we want to load data for a component.  Hereâ€™s where it happens on the initial load.

Then once Vue is started up the API calls start coming from the client side.

So we need a way to write the API calls in our component which works properly on the server-side and the client-side, which can be tricky.  Luckily Nuxt comes to the rescue again.

## Setup: A mock API for our app

In order to get started with grabbing data and displaying event, first weâ€™ll need an API for our app to access.

Just like in the Vue course, weâ€™ll set one up here using `json-server`. It lets you quickly create a mock API very quickly without setting up a server.

Before we install it, Iâ€™m going to write up the JSON data we want it to return ([download this file here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Code-Pop/real-world-vue/master/db.json)). Letâ€™s store this file in the root of our application.

Now letâ€™s get our JSON server installed and up and running. We can install it (if you havenâ€™t from previous courses) and get the command line tool (thatâ€™s the `-g`) by running:

```
  npm install -g json-server
```

Now to spin up this little API server we just run:

```
  json-server --watch db.json
```

When we run this line we should see:

```
    \{^_^}/ hi!
        
    Loading db.json
    Done
        
    Resources
    http://localhost:3000/events
        
    Home
    http://localhost:3000
        
    Type s + enter at any time to create a snapshot of the database
    Watching...
```

If we call up our browser and head over to `http://localhost:3000/events` we should see all of our events listed in json.

By default, our Nuxt app shows on port 3000 when doing development, but now the `json-server` that we started is now on that port. In order to start the Nuxt app on a different port you can run the `dev` command on a different port with the following:

```
    PORT=3001 npm run dev
```

That will start your application on port 3001 and youâ€™ll be able to make calls to the json-server API that lives on port 3000.

## Setup: Installing Axios for API calls

Just like in the Real World Vue course, weâ€™ll be using Axios to make HTTP requests to our API.

Axios is the ideal HTTP library for Nuxt. Nuxtâ€™s primary purpose is making it easy to create Universal JavaScript apps and Axios makes it easy to make HTTP requests on both the browser and the server.  

In the beginning of this course when we first set up our app using `create-nuxt-app` we installed the Axios module for Nuxt.

If you didnâ€™t install it initially, then run the following command to install it in your project:

```
    npm install @nuxtjs/axios
```

After that, open your `nuxt.config.js` file add the following lines:

*nuxt.config.js*
```javascript
    module.exports = {
      modules: [
        '@nuxtjs/axios',
      ]
    }
```

Notice weâ€™re not installing Axios itself, but rather the Nuxt Axios Module. It gives you a bunch of additional features out of the box such as:

- Integrated with Nuxt.js Progressbar while making requests
- Integrated with Proxy Module
- Auto retry requests with axios-retry

Thereâ€™s a bunch more features as well that you can learn about on the official [GitHub page](https://github.com/nuxt-community/axios-module).

## ðŸ›‘ Problem: How do fetch our EventList?

We want to list out all our events onto our front page, fetched from the API inside `/pages/index.vue`.  We want to fetch the events data server-side if the first request is our event list, and fetch the events data client side if weâ€™re navigating to this event page.

So, how do we make the API call to fetch events?  Unlike Vue.js out of the box weâ€™re not going to use the `created()` life-cycle hook.  Nuxt gives our components in the pages directory extra hooks, including:

## Solution: Nuxtâ€™s asyncData

`asyncData` is called every time before loading a **page** component, meaning a component located inside the `pages` directory. It will be called server-side once (on the first request to the Nuxt app) and client-side when navigating to further routes. This method receives [the context](https://nuxtjs.org/api/context) as the first argument, can be used it to fetch some data (via API) and then Nuxt will merge the return value with the component data.

The context argument gives you access to various properties like `app`, `$axios`, `params`, `route`, `error`, and more. In the previous lesson we used the context object to grab the route parameters. In this lesson, weâ€™ll use it to use axios.

## Grabbing the data for our event list

In previous lessons we created an event page that lives in the `index.vue` page in the root of our pages folder. Letâ€™s try using `asyncData` inside it to fetch events.

```html
    <script>
    export default {
      ...
      asyncData(context) {
        return context.$axios.get('http://localhost:3000/events').then(response => {
          return {
            events: response.data
          }
        })
      }
    }
    </script>
```

As you can see, we use the `$axios` object from the context and make our `get` request.  This returns a promise, and we specify using `then` what code to run when the promise returns.  In this case we return an object with `events` which will get merged into our component data.  We can simplify this code using ES6 destructuring like so:

```html
    <script>
    export default {
      ...
      asyncData({ $axios }) {
        return $axios.get('http://localhost:3000/events').then(response => {
          return {
            events: response.data
          }
        })
      }
    }
    </script>
```

Notice how we are destructuring the context object to take out just the $axios module which we need.

At this point if we look in our browser, and use Vue Dev Tools we can see that the data is getting loaded properly:

## Rendering our Event List

In the previous lesson, we put code right into the `page` component itself to render everything. But, the beauty of Vue is that you can organize your code into components.  We will now create an **EventCard** component that we will use to display each of our events:

ðŸ“ƒ **/components/EventCard.vue**
```html
    <template>
      <nuxt-link :to="'/event/' + event.id">
        <div class="-shadow">
          <span class="eyebrow">
            @{{ event.time }} on {{ parsedDate }}
          </span>
          <h4 class="title">
            {{ event.title }}
          </h4>
          <span>{{ event.attendees.length }} attending</span>
        </div>
      </nuxt-link>
    </template>
    <script>
    export default {
      name: 'EventCard',
      props: {
        event: Object
      },
      computed: {
        parsedDate() {
          const eventDate = new Date(this.event.date)
          return eventDate.toDateString()
        }
      }
    }
    </script>
    <style scoped>
    div {
      padding: 20px;
      margin-bottom: 24px;
      transition: all 0.2s linear;
      cursor: pointer;
    }
    div:hover {
      transform: scale(1.01);
      box-shadow: 0 3px 12px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 1px 15px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);
    }
    .title {
      margin: 0;
      color: black;
    }
    a {
      text-decoration: none;
    }
    </style>
```

Now inside the `/pages/index.vue` component we need to use the **EventCard** component.

ðŸ“ƒ **/pages/index.vue**
```html
    <template>
      <div>
        <h1>Events</h1>
        <EventCard
          v-for="(event, index) in events"
          :key="index"
          :event="event"
          :data-index="index"
        />
      </div>
    </template>
    <script>
    import EventCard from '@/components/EventCard.vue'
    export default {
      head() {
        return {
          title: 'Event Listing'
        }
      },
      asyncData({ $axios }) {
        return $axios.get('http://localhost:3000/events').then(response => {
          return {
            events: response.data
          }
        })
      },
      components: {
        EventCard
      }
    }
    </script>
```
And if we jump into the browser, we see our event listing:


![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578372934421_3.jpg?alt=media&token=cfde5d37-b755-409c-9f6c-1bd136728146)

## Error Handling

If we turn off the API server and jump back into the browser weâ€™ll see this error message:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578372941231_4.jpg?alt=media&token=65124850-1d0e-41b1-93da-68ec19626758)


This isnâ€™t optimal.  We should catch this error and provide a better error message.

```javascript
      asyncData({ $axios, error }) {
        return $axios.get('http://localhost:3000/events').then(response => {
          return {
            events: response.data
          }
        }).catch(e => {
          error({ statusCode: 503, message: 'Unable to fetch events at this time, please try again' })
        })
      },
```         

Notice weâ€™re including the error object which we can use in our catch block to use the error page we created in the last lesson.  In the browser our error page now looks like:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578372941232_5.jpg?alt=media&token=ed873d90-0f32-4e1e-a3d1-3b3cb6ae9ab8)


Much better!


## To ReVue

In this lesson we setup our mock API server and learned how to make API calls using the Nuxt Axios Module using the `asyncData` hook which is added to our page components.  We then added proper error handling to use our error component page.  In the next lesson weâ€™ll learn how to properly use async/await, implement our event show page, and get the progress bar working.
